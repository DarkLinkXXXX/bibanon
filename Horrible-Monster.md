Let me tell you a story about a horrible monster.
Like most horrible monsters, she was a small, pretty girl.
I met her in elementary school, before she became a terrifying beast.
I didn't actually become "friends" with her until high school, before that she was a fairly normal child , I believe.
But around the start of high school, she started to change.
Or rather, everyone else did.
Boys started working out and idolizing rock stars, girls started wearing tight clothes and fucking everything that moved,
but she stayed the same.
She called herself Baby.
While the other students started finding interest in the opposite sex, Baby still found interest in stuffed animals and fluffy skirts.
Being a true robot, I had no friends when I started high school.
Like a lot of you, the first lunch period of freshman year, I had no where to sit.
There was one completely empty table behind the disabled kids, which I assume was empty because no one wanted to sit by the disabled kids.
But I had no where else.
I sat down at the table on the far side of the kid who was listening to head phones and rocking enthusiastically.
I have nothing against disabled kids, he was just rocking into the chair behind him; Elmo Goes Over the Hill is a party song.
Shortly after I sat down and accepted that I would die alone as all robots do, something fluffy and pink appeared in the corner of my eye.
I looked up; it was a pretty girl.
I said, "H-Hel-Helsdfbgbfdfd."
She smiled at me vacantly and said, "May I sit with you?"
Not realizing that she was just being polite, not that she hadn't heard me, I breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Sure." 

###12829040 
She sat, carefully straightening her skirts.
She said nothing as she ate a tiny lunch.
Again, being a true robot, I didn't know when to keep my mouth shut.
I asked her, "What's you're name?"
She smiled lightly and said, "Baby."
I laughed and said, "Seriously?"
She turned toward me, she had big dark eyes and chubby pink cheeks. She really did look like a baby.
She said, "Yes," and went back to eating.
I realized I had been rude.
I said, "Sorry, I thought you were joking."
She said nothing.
"My name is Jake."
She said, "That's fine."
I didn't know what to say to that, she didn't sound sarcastic at all.
So I said nothing.
We sat together at lunch every day for the rest of the year.
Saying nothing every single day.

There's nothing wrong with any of that though, not really. 


###12829334 
We weren't really friends, clearly, we just sat together for forty minutes per day.
But I saw her through out the day too and sometimes action came to her.
Early on in the year, some girls came up to her at lunch.
They were your average whores, 14-year-olds wearing Ugg boots tucked into skinny jeans who had already taken three dicks in the ass a piece.
Apparently, these whores had beef with Baby.
A girl with a ridiculous poof of hair at the front of her head walked up next to baby and tipped her little Hello Kitty lunch box over.
She said, "You look like the Barbie isle at Wal-Mart puked on you."
Baby looked up at her with her empty smile and round eyes and said, "That's a terribly rude thing to do, you know."
The poof-headed whore laughed, "Who fucking cares what you think? Fucking dyke. No one cares what happens to you. Why don't you go home? Why don't you kill yourself too?"
I was quite shocked, never having seen girl-bullying before. The bullying I was used to was somebody bigger than you punches you in the arm, calls you a fag, and then walks away.
Baby wasn't having none of that shit.
She stood up, still smiling, pushed her chair in, and whispered into the girl's ear.
The look on her face melted into fear.
She backed up.
She said, "You're a freak! Cunt! Fucking faggot! Kill yourself!" as she kept backing up and eventually ran away.
The other girls stared.
I, too, stared.
Baby sat back down and cleaned up her lunch.
The other girls left, presumably to find their friend.
I asked Baby, "What did you say to her?"
Baby said, "Nothing that wasn't true."

That was a little unusual...

Nope, they're both girls. Sorry to disappoint.

Baby was the calmest person I had ever met.
A few other instances of girl-bullying happened, but every time, baby gave them no fun reaction, so it stopped fairly quickly.
But one day, something awful happened.
As Baby and I were leaving the cafeteria, and Baby was going to the library to skip gym as usual, someone spilled soup on her.
Now, even as a normal person, it sucks when someone spills food on you.
But for Baby, someone spilling food on you is comparable to being burned with fireplace poker.
She shrieked as though she'd just seen a baby carriage hit by a car.
The boy who did it was grinning like a little faggot and his friend elbowed him and said, "Whoops."
Baby.
Wasn't having.
None of that shit.
She grabbed his face with her long, decorated fingernails and dug at his eyes.
His friend left him and ran.
Everyone around us ran too.
The boy flailed and punched her as he tried to get away.
I stood and watched because I'm fucking useless.
The principal and school monitor came running in eventually, a lunch lady had run to the office and told them what was happening.
They pulled her off of him, her little pink Mary Janes kicking.
She screamed, "MYYYYY BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!!" as they carried her away.

It was fucking crazy.
The boy was mostly okay.

Meant to add

>looks like that guy now has 

>special eyes

YEEEEEAAAAHHH 


###12829769 
Baby didn't show up at school for a month.
I figured that she had been expelled or sent to the alternative school.
But then, a month later, Baby came back, in a fluffy mint green dress and little mint green matching shoes, smiling her vacant smile like nothing had happened.
At first i was hit with a rush of joy, she was back! MY lunch friend was back!
But then I remembered, this girl violently assaulted a boy for pouring soup on her.
I was still excited though.
I asked, "Baby, how are you? Where have you been?"
Baby's smile seemed to become less doll-like and more genuine. Maybe she thought it was nice that someone had missed her.
She said, "I go to the hospital sometimes. They just need to make sure I'm alright."
"Oh, did you get burned by it or something?"
"No."
"Oh, so like a mental hospital?"
"...Yes, like that."
"So you didn't get in trouble or anything?"
"No. That boy was in the wrong. He did a horrible thing and he was punished for it. I did nothing wrong, why would I get into trouble?"
Maybe because you clawed a guy's eye out?
But I said, "Oh, I was just wondering."
And that was the last we spoke of it.

Maybe girls really do get special treatment.

So freshman year ended, I only saw her once over summer break.
She gave me apple juice instead of whiskey.

>>12831552
Baby started talking to me more in sophomore year.
Which is great in a way, because at least I have some wild memories.

>Baby has her driver's permit
>having a permit means you can drive, but only if you have an adult in the car with you
>Baby's car had tinted windows, so
>Baby wasn't havin none of that shit
>turns out Baby loves driving
>she asks me one night if I want to go somewhere
>her room
>"The park I guess?"
>"I think that would be lovely. Be ready at five."
>I do as I am told
>for some reason, I just don't argue with Baby
>Baby pulls up at my house at five
>I had warning to her arrival because the house started shaking and a car alarm got set off by her music
>her (her dad's, I believe) car looks fancy
>it's all black and shiny and shit
>it bounces as the music inside blares
>the passenger door swings open
>powermetal blasts me in the face
>I cover my ears on reflex
>can't even keep my cool for a second in front of a girl
>she sees my discomfort and turns it off
>"Ah, sorry about that, I wasn't thinking."
>"It's okay."
>I get in
>"So do you still want to go to the park?"
>"Oh, wasn't that the plan?"
>"Sure, sure. That's fine. I just wondered if there was somewhere you'd rather go."
>I just sit there like a fucking idiot
>"The park it is!"
>She smiles that chubby-cheeked smile at me
>she's a surprisingly good driver for someone with presumably no experience

but then...
