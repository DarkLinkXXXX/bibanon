The Information Library is a gigantic collection of informative images from 4chan created by an anon called InformantB900. It composes 2,206 images containing guides, strange facts, and cool tips, organized in 180 folders. Who knows what kind of knowledge lurks in this collection?

You can obtain the entire thing [[here|Information_Library#downloads]].

made this, and this is for us to share. So continue to share as we continue to seek more information.

## Transcription Project

We will attempt to as many images into wiki pages as possible, so they will take up less space and become easier to update. That way, we could probably implement them into the [[Encyclopedia_Anonoma]].

The best way to convert images to text is with [[OCR]] programs. Run them through, edit any typos and format it with [[Markdown]], and just post them here.

All pages should conform to the same directory structure as on the Information Library's downloads.
