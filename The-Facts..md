At approximately 5pm UTC, on Thursday the 2nd of July, 2015, the moderators of /r/IAmA took their subreddit, which is one of the default set of reddit, private. The reason for this action was the sudden dismissal of Victoria Taylor, /u/chooter , who was a key part of the AMA process.  Head  moderator of /r/IAmA , /u/karmanaut , later explained in a submission in /r/outoftheloop , why /r/IAmA went private: https://archive.is/LvM7k 

At the time of writing this, there has been no explanation given by Reddit or Victoria as to why she was let go, and we will likely never get one. Ellen Pao herself, /u/ekjp , stated here https://archive.is/jAVL0 that she cannot comment on the matter.

After /r/IAmA went private, other subreddits that relied on Victoria for their AMAs quickly followed, as they had the same problem of being uncertain how to move forward with future AMAs. 
At this point, submissions is various other subreddits got posted, as users were wondering what was happening. Speculation quickly followed, until /u/karmanaut gave his explanation, and this in turn sparked everything, both subreddits going private and speculation from users, to snowball all over reddit. Moderators all across reddit were unhappy with both how the Victoria situation was handled, as well as a lack of communication and support for moderators. /u/mrmojorisingi , a moderator of /r/science , posted a very detailed description of why moderators are unhappy with reddit admins here: https://archive.is/6jk1U 

The likely most complete list of subreddits going private can be found here https://archive.is/6NJie 
1792 subreddits went dark in total 19 of these have over 3 Million subscribers. 
Based on traffic statisitics of the subreddit /r/outoftheloop , the place where /u/karmanaut gave his explanation, about 2 million users of reddit were affected by the blackout. Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/about/traffic/

During the chaos of subreddits going dark, reopening and some going dark again, and while users across reddit were brigading various subreddits that refused to go dark, or reopened, to go dark, Reddit admin and co-founder Alexis Ohanian , /u/kn0thing , communicated with moderators in a moderator only subreddit. Said post cannot be accessed by non moderators, but the content of said post was quickly leaked, and later reposted by /u/kn0thing himself here: https://archive.is/qyp1m

/u/kn0thing then later posted a reply about the situation to the larger reddit community, which sparked even more anger, especially after /u/brownboy13 posted what /u/karmanaut replied to /u/kn0thing in said moderator only subreddit. https://archive.is/OgFF3

Hate torwards Reddit admins exploded, when /u/kn0thing made his now infamous “popcorn tastes good” comment in reply to a user telling him that everyone is blaming Reddits failure to properly communicate with moderators. https://archive.is/3E3ar 
After this comment, hate torwards reddit admins exploded, and users dowvoted every comment of admins, even those that were made days before Victoria was let go. 


As a direct result or the admins failure to quickly and properly address the situation, reddit users brigaded every major sub that refused to join the blackout.
