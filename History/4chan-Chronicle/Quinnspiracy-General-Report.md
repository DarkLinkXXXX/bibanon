*General description about the incident for people to get up to date; because things move fast*

### Introduction

> **Corruption**  
> _noun: **corruption**; plural noun: **corruptions**_  
> _1. dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery._  
> _"the journalist who wants to expose corruption in high places"_  

Corruption has been with us since the dawn of civilization. It is the bane of our society, sowing the seeds of distrust, and robbing from the people. 

Some people believe that “money is the root of all evil”. Others look deeper and understand that “greed is the root of all evil”. 

Well, when you add greed with a pinch of dishonesty to a powerful position, you get a man who can tweak the systems of our society to give an unfair and undeserved advantage.

This is what has happened to the Game Journalism Industry. One woman gave benefits to Five Guys _(Editor’s Note: literally five different men, not a burger joint)_, in exchange for backing her less than stellar game. When readers criticized the practice, they were shunned or silenced by the Five Guys.

### Zoe Quinn's History

This scandal is hardly an isolated incident... *(Insert words here)*

*(write about Zoe's false and fabricated accusations of Wizardchan raiding her)*

*(write about Zoe's suppression of TFYC in favor of her own non charity effort)*

### The Incident

*(write something about the uncovering of rampant corruption in the game industry as a result. Make sure you have solid sources. 10/10 IGN)*

### 4chan's Campaign to Back TFYC

After discovering that Zoe tried to crush TFYC, /v/ and /pol/ launched Operation Chemo to fund the TFYC she hated so much; to bring attention to Zoe’s blatant hypocrisy; and most of all, to fight back against Zoe in a way that prevents 4chan from playing into her hands.

When TFYC recommended that /v/ create a new game character for them as a token of support; /v/ came up with a bunch of unsavory designs, until they eventually decided on the one that looked the most normal; Vivian James. 

The design of Vivian James gained resounding support for being utterly atypical of 4chan, and /v/ quickly adopted her as their musume (daughter).

Operation Chemo has currently hit an unexpected rut after TFYC’s Indiegogo was hacked by unknown forces on 8/24, throwing the entire project into disarray.
