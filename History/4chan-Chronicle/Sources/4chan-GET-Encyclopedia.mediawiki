{{4chanGETTOC}}
== 4chan GET Encyclopedia ==
Posted as the first reply of a post (2GET) or to mark milestone posts, especially in [[/b/]] (10,000GET, 100,000GET, etc). Originated on [[2chan]] and rapidly adopted by [[4chan]]. When a new posting milestone is near, [[/b/]]'s already high rate of posting increases tremendously, as the [[/b/]]tards scramble to score a GET. GETs often create new [[meme]]s, which is the primary reason that they are considered desirable. GETs of interesting number combinations are acknowledged on other boards depending on how busy the board is and how easy it is to get one, but not the way [[/b/]] does. However, interest in GETs has increase somewhat on [[/a/]], probably due to the board having enough posts for high-number GETs to occur. In true [[/b/]]tard tradition, when a GET is seen as shitty it is blamed on the mods, as unreasonable as that might be.

The concept of "GET" originated on 2channel (where 2GET and 1000GET, the first and last possible replies to a thread, are the ones considered desirable), but is modified on 4chan due to 4chan being primarily [[Imageboard|imageboards]] rather than text-based message boards. On the text boards, 2ch style GETs are sometimes seen.

A failed attempt at a GET is known as a FAILGET, a term which is also used to describe a GET that sucks. Conversely, an awesome GET is sometimes called a WINGET. It should be noted that the boards are coded in such a way that GETS are automatically stickied (or at least, they were; autosticky has since been disabled).

GETs on boards other than [[/b/]] are noticed and celebrated as well, especially on the larger boards such as [[/v/]] and [[/a/]], though they rarely get as much attention as /b/'s GETs. Sometimes, boards will try to "steal" each other GETs with their memes. /b/'s 10M "HazukiGET" is sometimes considered to be stolen by /a/, in turn /a/'s 1M MilhouseGET is considered to be a /b/ or /co/ theft, and so on - much myth surrounds these since the distinction between board userbases isn't nearly as clear as some would like you to believe, and if /b/ with its massive force tries to steal a GET it's over anyway.

=== First GETs ===
[[/b/]] was reset several times during [[4chan]]'s initial, chaotic incarnations. The first GET did not arrive until April 2004.

; 1 on /co/ : a .gif of Zoidberg from Futurama attempting to use a slinky, and having it catch on fire.

; 10 on /jp/ : [[Image:Cirno 10.jpg|80px|10 on /jp/]] Cirno from [[Touhou]] being [[promotions|promoted]]. A failget as she was going for the ⑨ 

; 100 on /jp/ : Cirno, with the image from 6666666 on /a/. Failed at getting 99. 99 was a text post of "Don't you think you're overreacting? We appreciate a new board but the reason all that was in /a/ was because it has its own community. Stuff happens on /a/ that you can't quite get anywhere else, and if you want to talk about vn's or something it was the place you were most likely to find someone with a shared interest"

; 999 on /jp/ : Overdrive animated gif from [[Touhou]], in a Cirno thread. The user's name was ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈ ➈. Close enough that he should stop trying until it's time for 6666 and 9999.

; 1000 on /jp/ : "1000 GET" with an photo of delicious dumplings. Considered a minor winget.

; 6809 on /g/ : an image of the 6809 CPU, a NerdGet. The first known deliberate GET on that board.

; 6666 on /jp/ : [[Image:Jp winget cirno.jpg|80px|6666 on /jp/ is an upside down Cirno]] The first real winget.

; 6969 on /jp/ : [[Image:6969.png|80px|6969 on /jp/: ⑥⑨⑥⑨]] A failed attempt at 6666 was suddenly turned into an unexpected winget, courtesy of Kohaku from [[Tsukihime]].

; 10000 on /vp/ : A post stating 'I don't even play Pokemon!' in spoilers.

; 50K on /g/ : An animated gif of Win2k-tan doing the Popotan dance.

; 77777 on /i/ : [[Image:InvadersGET.png|80px|77777 on /i/: ███████Tripfag████████ get]] Two old superheroes from WWII comics talking to each other. Deleted almost instantly. [http://www.lurkmore.com/wiki/File:InvadersGET.gif The full image from 77777's post on /i/: InvadersGET]

; 82042 on /lit/ : "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" Replying to a "post ending in X" thread, with the first -42 post deciding what book he would read. In Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, "the answer to Live, the Universe, and Everything" is 42.

; 99999 and 100K on /jp/ : [[Image:Jp100k_get.jpg|80px|99999 and 100K on /jp/]] Further proof that the creation of /jp/ is for the best of the /a/ board.

; 100K : "lol internet"  Possibly the most relevant GET of them all. It was a random reply by an Anonymous who apparently was not actually seeking the GET, but has spawned an enduring and important meme. [http://macrochan.org/get.py?sha1=BGGGMA5S7VLZYO5EB27E3ATAVGRLIDIB]

; 100K on /u/ : "I has a flute" Since 100KGET was an off-topic, utter [[/b/]]tard failget that was promptly deleted, it was agreed upon in the aftermath to nominate a picture of Shirou Emiya holding a sword drawn by tripfag Velox edited into Chikane Himemiya holding a flute by tripfag Kebinu as the 'honorary' 100K get.

; 123456 on /g/ (2006-Aug-08) : "in this thread we wonder how the OP can function in real life without any critical thinking skills." Yes, a reply to a mouthbreatingly-retarded support question.

; 125K on /g/ (2006-Aug-11) : DANGER OF DEATH icon, warning people to stay away from using ZoneAlarm.

; 137K on /u/ : "damn I really wanna see Shiznat fuck their own kids wouldn't that be cool /u/?" No image. Posted in a thread featuring artwork of the girls holding hypothetical test tube children. Not only a failget, but a sad and telling indication of just how deeply the Shiznat cancer has metastasized itself in /u/. Met with derision.[http://img155.imageshack.us/my.php?image=137000getusk4.png]

; 190K on /e/ : "what's the source of OP?" Anonymous later commented that this was the most relevant non-[[/b/]] get ever.

; 200K on /g/ (2006-Dec-26) : MacOS-tan LoliGET. "LOLI LOEV GET".
 
; 230K on /g/ : "Or maybe you're just a homo who can't configure his 'puter." Later regarded as more relevant than /e/'s 190k.

; 238K on /v/ : "increase contrast and brightness you fag" Referring to a joke screen about Doom 3 and Quake 4. [[Anonymous]] called it the worst fucking get ever.

; 300k on /co/ : "HomerGET". First recognized /co/ GET. Despite petitioning the mods, the GET was abandoned to die when it started to auto-sage.

; 310K on /tv/ : "You love them and their delicious love that never seems to work.", in a thread discussing the Season 6 finale of Scrubs, in which main characters JD and Elliot possibly get back together after being on and off for most of the series.

; 400K on /c/ : Desu GET. A picture of [[DESU|Suiseiseki]] wearing a nightgown. Decried by some for deliberately seeking a GET, which /c/ has never really cared about before. However, it was generally accepted as at least somewhat win. The thread quickly became an ordinary Suiseiseki thread.

; 400K on /g/ : [[Image:Jenny GET - 400K on g.png|80px]] Jenny GET; "GETs are stupid."

; 400K on /tv/ : A macro of a Mudkip shopped into a screencap from Doctor Who, with no text. [http://i11.tinypic.com/5yvdbpd.png]

; 500K : "meh meh 500k or not?" Image of an blue LED, user was supposedly banned for this post. Everyone attempting to create a Blue LED-tan meme was also banned. The thread was the place W.T.Snacks said the telling 'You don't "get" /b/.' comment, exhibiting the lack of regard the Mods had for the original Anonymous Imageboard culture, and considered the moment from when /b/ stopped being the awesome place that it had been.

; 500k on /co/ : LiefeldGET. a picture of an infamously bad artist named Robert Liefeld with the text ¨I´m a good artist!¨. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181073975334.jpg]

; 500k on /g/: Marisa Kirisame of [[Touhou]], beating out numerous /a/ssholes flooding [[Lucky Star]]. It was subsequently argued whether this GET belonged to /a/, to /v/ or to [[fail]], but this became [[moot]] as the thread ceased to exist within minutes.

; 600k on /co/ : Super Skrull GET. Image of the comic character Super-Skrull. Became recognized after the recent emergence of the Skrull meme on /co/. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181074301061.png]

; 650k on /co/ : April O´Neil´s tits GET. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181074339955.png Surprisingly win.]

; 700K on /co/ : Slyde Get. A random reply by Anonymous containing only the text "Slyde", referring to an obscure Marvel Comics villain who has a following on /co/ due to a highly amusing appearance in a somewhat recent Spider-Man issue, in which he tries to act like he's Spidey's arch-rival and utters lines such as "Did you not see the Slyde Punch?". Due to Slyde's popularity on the board, it was considered a WinGET despite its ordinary nature.[http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/3369/700000hk3.jpg]

; 777777 on /co/ : AkiraGET. /a/ get in an /a/ related thread. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181073924802.png]

; 800K on /co/ : Slyde Get 2. Unlike the first Slyde Get, this one was a deliberate attempt by the [[tripfag]] "███████Tripfag████████ !REDREDLOGo" (800K was also the first time the /co/mrades actually flooded the board in pursuit of a GET). It contained the text "SURAIDO GET!" (Engrish for "SLYDE GET", thus implying that Tripfag is a weeaboo), and a picture of Slyde being shot in the head during the Civil War: War Crimes one-shot, which is the 4th and most recent time that Slyde has been killed. While the GET received a somewhat mixed response (as it depicted the death of a /co/ favorite), it was mostly considered another WinGET.[http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/2593/800000fm0.jpg] Especially in light of it defeating a TrollGET attempt (a picture of Iron Man, who's widely hated on /co/, and the text "All hail", which ended up as /co/'s 799999th post. This FailGET was considered highly appropriate.[http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/7003/799999bx3.jpg] The other near-miss, at 800001, was a picture of Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition, with no text. This was considered awesome because, appropriately, no one expected it. Some argued that it would've made a better GET than Slyde, but others felt that its appearance immediately after the GET was even less expected and thus more appropriate.[http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7315/800001um4.jpg]

; 888888 : "almost" [http://img74.imageshack.us/img74/8932/almostfq8.jpg] This GET spawned a short lived almost meme.

; 888888 on /co/ : Spider-Man floodGET. Fail like no other. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181074495966.png]

; 900K : A picture of [[Raptor Jesus]], then switched by moderators to a picture of a man with a donut on his penis. [http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1858/11350075438787ej.jpg]

; 900K on /co/ : A random Anonymous reply saying "GTFO FAG" in a thread attempting to score the GET for [[/co/#Squirrel Girl|Squirrel Girl]], one of /co/'s favorite characters. Widely considered a FailGET. 900001, however, was another near miss by Iron Man, and was hailed as the true GET. It was also [[9000|OVER 900000!!!]].[http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/9216/900001nq4.jpg]

; 919K on /co/ : "Does Marvel know at all how much Sally Floyd is hated?

: Like, has someone stood up at one of those editor panels at the convention and yelled into the mic "THAT FUCKING WHORE NEEDS TO DIE!"?"

: Upside-down 616(the number of the Marvel universe)-GET. Sally Floyd is a dumb bitch reporter that told Captain America he's a bad superhero because he doesn't have a Myspace or watch American Idol or NASCAR. She (along with Cap's non-response to her bullshit) also represents the fact that Marvel writers have forgotten that Cap was unfrozen decades ago, not yesterday, and thus is well aware that it's no longer the 1940s.

; 950K on /co/ : "I do"
: "ConfimationGET. A tripfag telling Anonymous that she read more Alan Moore books after enjoying Promethea. Not a fail get, but not very win either. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1181074840482.png]

; 1M : [[Image:Orgasmget.png|80px|orgasmGET]] "Female Orgasm" text with a sketch of Sae Sawanoguchi from the anime Magic Users Club in sexual bliss. [http://macrochan.org/get.py?sha1=EPQKDCVYAXXBMCZYWFKB64EOFXVBYINH] Seconds later, the post was deleted and mods stickied another post with the picture of a budgie in a jar originally named 'Bonzai Budgie' but quickly dubbed 'Bottle Budgie'. The post number was also changed to be 1000000 with many users believing the original 1M GET was false in preference of this.
<br clear="all" />

; 1M on /a/ : Milhouse in a tuxedo, standing triumphant with the text "MILHOUSE GET". Widely considered the greatest get ever or the worst get ever, depending on if you were trolling or not. The gigantic red "X" and word "NO" that was subsequently edited over the picture thumbnail has contributed to the widespread belief that the get was fixed by the mods. Was nevertheless stickied and remained at the top of /a/ for days, igniting a shitstorm of argument, mainly by Haruhi fans who thought the mods had cheated them out of a get with a MySQL failure just before the get happened (Haruhi got 1000001). Dozens of calls went out for the picture to be deleted as Milhouse was not only not a meme but also off-topic; the mods ignored these calls, which all but assures it was indeed a mod get. [http://i12.tinypic.com/2vinnyq.jpg]

; 1M on /co/ : Fail GET. During the flood of /co/ by /a/ and several other boards just before the get, the actual 1M Get wound up as a deleted image (believed to be of Myron Reducto from the cartoon ´Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law´) simply stating "Reducto Get" next to it.  Later the members of /co/ decided they wanted to pretend they had a good get and created a new image. The image comprises of a newspaper with a picture of supervillain Hank Scorpio reading " Supervillain Seizes 1M GET", with the theme tune for Hank Scorpio (from the credits of the Simpsons episode Scorpio originates from) posted with it. [http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/6589/co1mio0.jpg] This new GET has been called the RETCON GET, the term used for changing or adding information, used heavily in most comics.

; 1M on /ck/ : Ryu from street fighter and Cyclops from X-MEN shaking hands from capcom vs marvel. Ryu representing with the text "/v/" and Cyclops representing with "/co/" from their respective boards of interest. /v/ and /co/ steal the GET just seconds after a rush of spam during the last one hundred posts to the GET by /b/. Comments consisted mostly of RAGE and cheer from the native /ck/ as they were relieved that /b/ did not get the GET. [http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/8999/covhate.jpg] Considered an EPIC get with no other /v/ or /co/ posts spamming in all of /ck/ during the rush for the GET except this one and both /v/ and /co/ boards stealing a GET from /b/ successfully. This may be the first GET in history that two boards collaborated together to get a GET from /b/ successfully.

; 1M on /jp/ : [[Image:Yukkuri_MarisaReimu.png|80px|1M featured]] "Take it easy." GET featuring the original Yukkuri. Was stickied shortly after it was posted and stayed up for less than a day.  Liked by many, and was said to become the new rule 1 of /jp/.  Even the servers were taking it easy during the GET.

; 1M on /k/: A deleted post in a [[/k/#Katana Vacuum|probable troll]] thread. No one is sure how hard it failed, but it had to be pretty bad.[http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/2885/1mfailfs3.gif]

; 1M on /m/: Love-Love GET featuring Domon and Rain from ''G Gundam''. Happened on the same day as /a/'s 8M, but as usual /m/ is self-secluded and no one notices as a WIN GET passes by unruined.

; 1111111 on /co/ : ¨Is it can be NSFW Sunday?¨. Created /co/´s NSFW Sunday. [http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f55/malomeat/1182583481429.png]

; 1.25m on /co/: Holy GET.  During a thread in which /co/ wrote their own bible, Nameless !2JF1umrU16 managed to achieve an overwhelming winGET with an unintentional typo and a cry for the thread to be stickied.  Only he forgot to include his name after trolling /v/.  He was later hailed Bearer of the Holy GET.

; 2M on /a/ : Mariya from the anime ''Otome Wa Boku Ni Koishiteru'', with a facial expression similar to Grinbitch's "Oh ho, why not whore ourselves?" picture. Considered an even more collossal failure than 1M, Moot himself personally intervened, handing down the judgment "SHIT SUCKS FAGGOT" and banning the [[Anonymous]] who posted it. [http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/2163/2mgethw3.jpg]

; 2M on /v/ : Pipboy GET. An image of Pipboy, the mascot of the Fallout series.  Considered a winget, especially since /b/ was heavily attempting to steal the get at the time. [http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c119/SPAJEW/060512_pipboy.jpg The image] and the post were deleted after being autosaged.

; 2M on /co/ : Onyx GET. Notorious poster Wyatt Creed, known for repeatedly posting pictures of girls from the cartoons Horseland and Trollz, posted a picture of the character Onyx from the cartoon Trollz with the "Onyx GET" caption. Shitstorm soon follow. [http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/954/wyattkingvq0.jpg]

; 2.1M : Contained the text "Thanks b, I always change the background here to something cool on caturday." No image. 

; 2222222 on /co/ : Contained the text "Oh, thats an important distinction." No image. Considered a failure, as Booster Poke came from the future half an hour before to declare that 2222222GET would have no image and be a failure.

; 2.4M : Contained an anonymous user replying to a gif of someone fucking a fleshlight with the text "I soooo want this now." Considered a failure. 

; 2.5M on /a/ : March 27, 2007. Photograph of a woman with a mouth full of Nilla Wafers cookies. As the get neared, posting increased to such a furious pace that the entire ten pages was wiped clean in under fifteen seconds, and the get itself survived less than five seconds on the board before it too was pushed off. Multiple sources providing screenshots confirmed the get, at which point /a/ erupted in furious protest. The get had usurped attempts by at least four different factions (Haruhi fans, ''Touhou'' fans, Jun Watarase fans and ''Death Note'' fans) to claim it. Most infuriated were the latter group, who had hoped to secure the get with an image of the famous "JUST AS PLANNED" scene from ''Death Note'', the anime version of which had just aired earlier that day. (Some trolls cracked that this was in fact "JUST AS PLANNED" to deny them the get.) Most of the vitriol was directed at the mods, featuring unusually harsh language; (one /b/-type image somehow squeezing in among a flood of anime images, a MySQL error just as the get happened, etc.) and, even worse than Milhouse, the image was a photograph, not even drawn (it wasn't even an ''amusing'' image to begin with). Most users believed /a/ gets could not possibly get worse than 2M; as usual, the power of FailGET was tragically underestimated.[http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/8877/2500000failgetlc8.png]

; 2.6M : Posted in a thread that had a picture of black Jesus, with the text "JESUS SAVES 4CHAN!" The get itself was the first responce in the thread, simply "lets hope". 

; 2.6M on /a/ : A Yaranaika GET. Many [[Anonymous]] considered this as a WinGET since the many epic FailGETs in /a/, though there was some limited dissent, especially among those attempting to score the GET for [[/a/#Jun Watarase|Jun]].[http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/3413/2600000fz6.jpg] It was followed immediately by a post containing a pic of [[Slowpoke]] and text claiming it to be a Mod GET. It was to moments later with another Slowpoke pic and the text "Damnit".[http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/9657/2600001ym4.jpg] Given that missing a GET by exactly one post is just as impossible to time as the actual GET, SlowpokeFailGET most likely really was the work of the mods.

; 2666666 on /tv/: "Can't Hardly Wait" GET.  Picture of the movie poster for the film "Can't Hardly Wait" with the text "Can't Hardly Wait 2666666GET?"

; 2.7M on /a/ : "SMALL BOSS GET": a screenshot of the ''Nanoha StrikerS'' character Reinforce II (known on /a/ as "Small Boss") with the subtitle "Ah, looks like something really bad is happening." Some Anonymous felt that the text was appropriate given /a/'s spate of FAILGETS, but others denounced this as a FAILGET as well.

; 3M (2005-Oct-16): "TIME PARADOX/What a lame GET/Surely you jest". Accompanied pic was Waha and Pedobear with an explanation of how they're seen in Japan and in America. The post had a file with a UNIX timestamp after the 3,000,001st, and the poster PixelHotness being friendly with the Mods, caused some users to believe it was faked.

; 3M on /a/ : FILE DELETED, following a massive spate of MySQL connection failures, possibly caused by an anti-flood feature. Pushed off the board almost instantly. Text was the smiley "XD". Badly photoshopped "proofs" trying to claim the GET filled the board afterwards. Since the image was deleted, some users settled on a "[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni#Hanyuu|blank]]" image from ''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'' as a placeholder. 2999999 was about ''[[Lucky Star]]''.

; 3M on /v/ : [[File:Armpitget.jpg|80px]] "ArmpitGET". A picture of Reimu Hakurei from the ''Touhou'' games, arms raised over her head and baring her infamous armpits. Finally became 4chan's first ''Touhou''GET, but lasted less than a minute before being bumped off in the rush of posting. Was not stickied. Some malcontents accused /a/ of stealing their get and have begun plotting to steal /a/'s 3MGET, unaware or ignorant that (1) ''Touhou'' is a video game series and (2) the mods and /b/ are already engaged in stealing /a/'s gets. Widely considered a FAILGET.

; 4444444 on /v/ : [[Image:4444444get.jpg|80px|Tripfag GET]] A picture of Scorpio from the PS2 game "Devil Kings", during his "M'LORD" face, which is often used as a response to offensive or shocking OP images.  Was taken by the Tripfag Adol Christin, though the archived thread displays mixed feelings about the get(About 1/4 win, 1/4 acceptable, 1/2 TRIPFAG GET IS FAILGET).

; 4.5M : A text post containing only the word "eee". There was no image. Widely considered a failed GET. The clamour to get the 4.5 millionth post caused a lengthy MySQL failure. -01/22/06

; 4.5M on /v/ : A shiny Charizard.

; 4.5M on /a/: A hybrid GET of Azumanga Daioh, Twelve Kingdoms, and Giovanni from Pokemon, with the text "GETs considered harmful". At first it was considered an IronyGET due to the irony of the message, but became a WinGET - because of the surprise image of Giovanni punching Chansey, Giovanni became an instant hit on /a/, spawning off dozens of Giovannipunch shoops and his rising GAR status.

; 4.6M : "I'll win this stupid GET-contest with perfect timing. You'll see" [http://macrochan.org/get.py?sha1=EAJ2U4L63TQRJW6JXXHAY4LCBIOUY54L]

;4.7M on /a/: "And no that is not the pasta of the copy where I exactly type this entirely all. Have sexual intercourse." Posted in a thread full of copypasta.

; 4.8M on /a/: "GET, GET, GETTER GET!" The raging war between /m/ and /a/ continues with this stickied GET featuring Getterbot (oh, the irony). 4799999 was a picture of Konata from ''Lucky ☆ Star'' doing the victory sign with the text "Ha!" that was also stickied; user was banned.

; 5555555 on /a/: Cirno get. Was stickied, with modfags and Touhoufags stating it was a WinGET and everyone else telling them to gb2/v/.

; 5.6M on /a/: "NUTBLADDER = EXPLODE" GET = GOT. GetGods love ''Hidamari Sketch'', and so does /a/.

; 5.7M on /a/: "conti get". Approved by Anonymous but considered a Semi-FailGET. Firstly, newfags assumed it was a [[Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann|Gurren-Lagann]] GET because of the wallpaper's style (although GAINAX produced both FLCL and said show); /m/orons also tried to say they stole the get, despite Canti being a ROBOT that isn't necessarily placed in the MECHA category. Secondly, the OP was using Windows Vista along with his real name "Phil" present on his desktop (thankfully "Phil" didn't use a tripcode). Thirdly, Canti's name wasn't even spelled correctly.

; 5.8M on /v/: [[Lucky Star]] get featuring Konata in a cardboard box labeled ''Gundam''. Particularly infuriating to /v/ as "Lucky Star will never be a get on /v/" was a sticky for quite some time during the 5M get.

; 5.8M on /a/: "DESU THIS" get. With all the RM fags moved to desuchan.net, there is a very lacking amount of support for the series anymore. And thus, including that the picture features male cosplayers and an airsoft, this is labeled as a FailGET but instantly turned to win once the USER WAS BANNED. [http://i4.tinypic.com/30l2e1c.jpg]

; 6M on /v/: PizzaCatGET.  A screencap from a Samurai Pizza Cats video game stating "We have won!!" with no text.  Status is currently debated.  Some claim that /a/ stole the GET, but although /a/ was indeed heavily attempting to steal the GET (5999999 ended up being [[Jun Watarase]]), the image came from a video game, and most of /a/ admitted defeat, making a ste/a/lGET unlikely.  Considered a WinGET.

; 6M on /a/: A deleted image with the subject: "Yoko GET". Quickly purged due to a rush of faggots trying to get a GET.

; 6M on /co/: A post consisting of "*holds up spork*" in reply to an attemtped GET involving a bear with a machine gun surfing on a shark.

; 6.1M on /a/: September 16th, "SPAM MORE FAGGOTS" Tripfag (''Penis Engine Mechanic !PenisjjSpE'') get with a picture of some random Japanese voice actress. Decreed a failGET in addition to stealing what potentially was suppose to be a GAR Kittan GET ([[Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann|Gurren-Lagann]] 25 just aired that day along with a rush of SHITSTORM on /a/) along with a mixture of [[Lucky Star]] GETS and robot-lover (''Idolm@ster Xenoglossia'') GETS. However, the irony is quite delicious. (Kittan was "redeemed" later in the day by 6111111 "GET": a topic consisting of a screenshot from the infamous episode 4 depicting Kittan and his 3 sisters waving their rear-ends around, accompanied by text linking to the post itself. This was stickied for around an hour and declared semi-win, but not an actual GET.)

Dividely considered a failed GET, while others chuckle at it being the perfect GET. It was hated perhaps due to its usurping of the GET from the Desu~ and Gaston camps. This was followed by the board crashing. Can be seen at [http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b321/dutchprincess/666get.jpg]

; 6666666 on /v/: New Dracula GET.  Image of Graham Jones from Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow with the text "NEW DRACULA GET".  While most newfags saw this as a winGET due to the relevance of the image and the number, the rest of /v/ declared it a fucking failGET due to the fact that Graham was NOT the new Dracula in Aria of Sorrow, and that he had previously been known to /v/ as an extremely horrible Ultros clone (even by /v/ standards) that laughs at his own jokes and tries to explains his own punchlines.

; 6666666 on /a/: Against all odds, Upside-down Cirno (9 -> 6) was the get (which was accurately predicted right before the get). Thread got purged in a mere 2 minutes. Also see 5555555 on /a/. [http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/7098/a6666666.jpg]

; 7777777 on /v/: METALSEADRAMON GET.  An image of Metalseadramon from a Digimon anime.  Despite Digimon technically being a video game, users representing /a/ claimed credit for the GET, resulting in initial hatred for the GET and further fueling the fires of the hatred between /a/ and /v/.  However, the GET was later turned to win when an anonymous user inverted the image and revealed that Metalseadramon's facial expression and position bore an eerie resemblance to the Xbox Kid.

; 7777777 on /a/: "Lucky-Star-Sucks GET!" Also commented on SaiMoe winner and what to do if it was a get. However, this post was not significant; what was was 7777775, which had [[/a/#Yami|Yami]] from ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' on his posting spree of hitting 5's extremely often. Was declared King of GETS soon after.

; 15M : October 28, 2006. Although a sticky was created, few people actually witnessed the 15M get post. The 15M get was a picture of the Mooninites from ATHF with the text "SPACECATAZ" [http://www.cerbr.us/files/pic/4chan/postget/15milget.jpg]

; 15.2M : November 01, 2006. A picture of a Deku from The Legend of Zelda, with the eyes colored [[desu|Red and Green]],along with the text "deku get, ~deku".

; 15.3M : November 03, 2006. Picture of man smoking a pipe, saying, "In Canada, AIDS comes in bags," with the text "AIDS AIDS AIDS". Although the GET was not a meme, it was still considered to be the first WinGet  in a long time by most users. Similarly, some users said that it was a step towards redeeming the 15M FailGet.

; 15.4M : November 05, 2006.  In response to a thread of someone trying to get, the post had no picture and the text "no me."  It was debated whether or not this was win or fail.

; 15555555 : [[File:15555555.PNG|80px]] November 11, 2006. One thread in the inevitable flood of posts, with a picture from some manga and the text "lay doze hoez". Whether it was a win GET or a fail GET was argued upon in the thread.

; 15555555 on /a/ : Kallen stealing [[Yami]]'s GET. Considered better than Yami getting the GET himself.

; 15829229 : November 16, 2006. In >>15827097, a Borat imagemacro saying "GREAT SUCCESS!" was posted, predicting that ">>15829229 WILL BRING UPON THE END OF THE WORLD AND [[/b/]] THE GREATEST GET EVER!!!!!!!!!" [[/b/]] was temporarily excited about this new arbitrary GET and speculated what it might be. Soon enough, >>15829229 turned out to be a post simply saying "not enough nerve endings," in response to a girl (?) who said "I'd trade my vagina for a PENIS anyday" in a thread about gender swapping. [[/b/]] was ambivalent about whether this constituted a satisfactory GET.

; 16M : [[Image:16M.GET.png|80px|Real 16M GET]] [[Image:16M.GET.Fake.png|80px|Fake 16M GET]] November 20, 2006. 16M was an image of [[Habbo Hotel]]. In the image two Habbo men in blue banana hammocks were circled and beside the screenshot, an image two men from a gay porn site wearing the same outfits. Unanimously considered a horrible get, it was briefly stickied but deleted within 10 minutes. Trolls tried to claim that 16M was a [[Drama|furry]] get, posting this image as "proof", but it was later revealed to be an obvious shop.

;16m-/v/ : June 8, 2008. a picture of the cover for game Dead Rising for Xbox 360 with the title replaced with "PS3 LAUNCH" posted by Edmund Burke.

; 16161616 : November 23, 2006. Ultimately called a win due to the suckage of the previous gets. The picture was thought to be called "Daddies Girl" with "16161616 GET" written next to it. 

; 16.8M : December 06, 2006. This get was small in notice as it happened during "low" traffic hours, but it was a get nonetheless. It was a non-image post with the saying "Fuck You Kangajew" in response to a religious mockery thread. This was concidered a FailGet by all who witnessed it. It should also be noted that some are trying to force this phrase as a meme, though it is failing and has faded out of existence.  '''What the hell?  The link is nothing like that.  Who fucking wrote this?'''

This was concidered by some to be a WinGet due to the nature of 17MGet; though by the end the confusion following 17MGet, it was aptly named a FailGet similar to past FurGets.

; 17M on /v/: June 30, 2008. Action Hank from Dexter's Laboratory smoking a cigar with the text "What did you just say, motherfucker?"

; 17.7M : December 22, 2006. Perhaps one of the most successful trolls in 4chan history, depicting a picture of Cockmongler. The thread was saged and many people refused to post in it due to the fact that it would only make the troll more successful. Epic win. [http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2420/thread177mgetuv4.jpg]

; 17777777 : December 24, 2006. /b/ froze for a few minutes while everyone frantically tried to post the get. Ultimately, when /b/ loaded again, it was an image of Naruto with the text "KAGE BUSHIN NO JITSU GET." Classified instantly as a failget.

; 17.9M : [[Image:17.9milGET.JPG|80px|False 17.9M GET]] December 26, 2006. A text reply to a "Post from your wii" thread, it read simply "Non-wii post". Considered a small winget because it happened in the middle of the HUEG nyoro~n spam, and everybody was expecting the get to be wasted to that raid. Pissing in an ocean of piss, etc.

; 19M on /v/: August 21, 2008. An post without an image saying "FUCKING JAPAN TIME" during a japantime revival thread. Was followed with many shouts of SAKURAIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, with many believing that Sakurai had come to troll /v/ one last time, stealing their get. Generally considered to be a failget.

; 19M on /a/: February 18, 2009. GARUTO get. Due to recent Naruto chapters of him fighting village-destroyer Pain, a flash of Gaiafag mobs invaded /a/ with this forced meme featuring Naruto wearing Kamina's glasses, thus the deeper shithole /a/ already is. 19000001 was also GARUTO get. True get was [[/a/#Imoutits|Imoutits]] at 18999999.

; 19M : [[File:19000000.JPG|80px]] January 13, 2007. One of many threads posted in the great flood; the picture was of an owl fancifly carved out of a watermelon with the macro "HOLY SHIT - THIS IS AWESOME", accompanied by text "random get!". Considered to be not a great GET, but not a bad one either. Also noted that 18999999 and 18999998 were the Cockmongler and :3chan respectively.

; 19.8M : January 30, 2007.  Second DESU GET was got in a Suiseiseki flood.  Picture was of Suiseiseki (obviously) and text was a flood of "desu" (obviously).  Significant because it's the first repeat GET in 4chan history, not counting minor GETs.  [http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p152/kytemidnight/DesuGET.png]

; 19969661 : [[File:19969661.jpg|80px]] February 2, 2007.  A picture of some CounterStrike terrorists, with the text "These men are mooninites." This was a test on the terrorist->mooninite wordfilter, and was a win (though the post that pointed out that it was a special number won more). The relevance of the number is that it is indeed an upside down reverse palindrome GET.

; 20M : [[Image:20milget.JPG|80px]] [[Image:20mget.jpg|80px]] February 3, 2007. Naked Asian chick. Fail get. Upon taking a closer look, 20000001 was the same exact picture as 20M get, except it had the text "THAT FUCKING CAT!" next to it. Due to the large amount of MySQL errors around the time, some believe 20000001 was actually the real 20M get. Not even stickied.  Upon being clicked, the image was really an image of Naruto. [http://www.lurkmore.com/wiki/File:20mget-1.jpg The post's full image when clicked.]

; 21M : [[Image:21milget.jpg|80px]] February 22, 2007. Picture of Natalie Portman, with the text Portman GET. The fail of the get is masked by the fact that seconds after it was posted, it was sage'd off of 4chan due to the massive spam.

; 21.2M : [[Image:Cockget.JPG|80px]] February 25, 2007. Text in a grouphug.us style topic, simply stating "I think I might like the cock." Debated as to whether or not it was a win or fail.

; 21.6M : March 4, 2007. In a thread which was trying to get 21.6M get but ended up getting the 21599950th post. But on the 3rd post in the thread, someone replied and that which just so happened to be 21.6M GET. There were debates on whether this was a fail get, but the majority of the thread were saying it was a Win GET, most likely because of the irony.

; 22222222 : March 14, 2007 at 18:42:18. It featured a fat woman with the accompanying post "FATGET". OP was banned soon after, and "FATGET" was wordfiltered to "I AM A HUGE FAGGOT. PLEASE RAPE MY FACE." in large bold font with the <blink> tag. Generally accepted as lesser win, at the least.

; 22666666 : [[Image:22666666GET.png|80px]] March 22, 2007 at 00:18:00. Although not intented to be a GET post, it happened to be.

; 22.8M : March 24, 2007 at around 2PM GMT. OP posted a picture of what can only be assumed was himself, and the post made directly after that were the words "WELL TEN". While this is still a 'meme-in-progress' most [[/b/]]tards know that the perpetuation of such faggy [[meme]]s will cause insta-death. Considered epic fail.

Morons think this is a modGET due to the numerous MySQL connection failures occurring directly before the GET as well as screenshots of what appears to be a sticky without a picture, because they are morons and don't understand the internet. Also, Pokemon GET. An hour or 2 after, the OP of the GET was banned, due to the fact that [[moot]] and the admins are trying to return [[/b/]] back to its former glory.

Most of which /a/ secretly enjoyed, so the internal raid was fail.  It is unlikely that 28M was /a/'s doing, as /a/ at the time was busy spamflooding itself with Lucky Star threads and would likely have chosen same for /b/'s consumption.

A fairly controversial GET of the anime versions of the ''Power Puff Girls'' surrounded by Cartoon Network American characters with the Anonymous text, "Shit. Getting closer". There were suspicions of a joint effort by the denizens of /a/ and /co/, but while some of those boards claim credit the sources are mainly unfounded, making a /co/oper/a/tion unlikely. 

; 30.2M : [[Image:30.2MGET.PNG|80px|30.2M]] June 18, 2007. A response to a "Would you hit it?" thread. Not that exciting.

Although the text implies that the image may be CP, the image was not deleted due to it being impossible to tell.  Mixed reaction, with about 1/3 of /b/tards claiming WinGET, 1/3 claiming FailGET, and 1/3 claiming "35600000 is NOT A GET you fucking newfags!"

; 36M : August 12, 2007. DraeneiGET.  Fanart of a topless female draenei (a race of World of Warcraft) with the text "am i a meme yet?".  Regarded as an even bigger FailGET than 35M.  As usual, some /b/tards called ModGET (a practice that is noticeably getting tiresome, with one poster spamming "MODGET BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT!" in retaliation).

; 36.5M : August 17, 2007. FaithGET. A picture of Faith, the bipedal dog, with the text "36500000GET." As is the norm with GETs these days, it was first considered a winGET, then a failGET, and then just a fucking argument. However, there is also an argument if the 100k/500k GETs are even considered GETs anymore.

; 36.9M : [[Image:369MGET.png|80px|36.9M]] August 21, 2007 Tuesday at 08:25:36. An obvious newfag and/or gaiafag trying to be epic with a GET.

It was instantly considered a failGET by everyone except the usual newfags that think everything is "EPIC." Interestingly, it is the second time that Slowpoke became a GET, and although the last time Slowpoke was a WinGET, most consider this a FailGET due to the fact that Slowpoke was actually on time for once.

Just the letter "u" as part of a reply for "sux" in 3 separate posts to a looking up picture of a guy wearing only a skirt and having his cock dangling.

; 39M : September 9, 2007 at 10:35PM EST. A picture of a BOX FULL OF AIDS with the caption "I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS". /b/ doesn't realize that modgets don't actually exist because /b/ is full of a bunch of children that don't know anything about 4chan. Almost all of the old school 4channers have left 4chan because of this.  Either way, it cannot be considered a FailGET due to the fact that it is strangely appropriate for the current state of /b/.

; 39.2M : September 12, 2007. libidoGET: A picture of Kurt Cobain, smiling, with the text "A LIBIDO".

; 39888888 : September 18, 2007. "LOST: THE GAME" image accompanied by the text "39888888888888 get".  Mostly considered win.  As a matter of fact, this also broke 4chan and all of servers had to be fixed immediately after the rush of /b/tards trying to get this non-get. /b/ really lost the game on this one.  By the way, you just lost the game.

; 39.9 : September 19, 2007. The letter "g", a reply to a thread trying to get the get. Deemed a failGET by most. [http://img116.imageshack.us/my.php?image=1190196985712ny6.jpg]

; 40M : September 20, 2007. High school picture of some homosexual, with the text "hey /b/, Do I look cute?" A cataclysmic failGET; the failure of this get was so intense it could be seen from the past. [http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/5500/faildv1.png] Although it was stickied, it was subsequently deleted in less than an hour.

; 40404040 : [[Image:EFG_GET.png|80px|40404040]] September 23, 2007. EFG's feet, which was the third part of an EFG combo. This is coinsidered a triple-failGET, because 1. it's EFG, 2. it's a combo, and 3. 3-piece combos don't count as real combos and are rightfully considered fails. What made this GET humorous, however, was this. The objective stated by the OP was a "3-hit fortune combo". This, effectively, was what EFG got.

; 41M : September 29, 2007.  BeefGET.  Image of Captain Beefheart with a fortune, but no other text.  Yet another failGET in a long line of failGETs.  Doesn't even deserve funny or mocking text here.  [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/41000000/41M+get/]

; 41414141 : October 2, 2007.  Dragon Porn.  Image of two dragons fucking.  Hardly any attention drawn.

; 41999999 : October 7, 2007.  A picture of a white mouse, fortune "Very Bad Luck", text "The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything". The true 42m GET.

=== 42 Million ===
; 42M : October 7, 2007. Pizza GET. A picture of a pizza burned to a black, charcoal-like crisp. Extremely copious amounts of fail. [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=42000000&x=42M+get]

=== 43 Million ===
; 43M : October 16, 2007. DSFARGET. A picture of the meme DSFARGEG. 

; 43.6M : October 26, 2007. WalrusGET: An imageless post containing the text "huge fucking walrus". 

=== 44 Million ===
; 44M : October 31, 2007. CockphoneGet. A responce to a thread which said "looking for the pic of the asian chick with the dick on her ear saying HERROO!?!". The responce said "amidoinitrite". The answer was no, because the picture posted was of a non asian chick holding a double ended vibrating phalis to her ear and mouth making a "ch" face. Debatable winGET.

; 48M : [[Image:Epic Fail Candidate2 1.jpg|80px|48M failure: Epic Fail Campaign]] December 10, 2007. Ron PaulGET. A response to an EFG thread where EFG was trying to get the GET. No image. Most deem it a failGET but still in consideration, as it's in an EFG thread but it's mother fucking Ron Paul.

; 48484848: December 18, 2007. KIM FUCKING DEAL response to a thread about female musicians that don't suck ass.

; 50M : Emo GET. A picture of some bosnian whining about his LJ getting hacked blah blah blah. Only received 13 replies before it was either deleted or ignored. The fail of this GET is so unimaginable that science has not found a way to properly measure it.[http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=50000000&x=50M+-+fixed+chin-chan+get+]

; 50555555 : hij/a/cked GET. A picture of Kira from Death Note in a thread which proclaimed "The 50555555get will be fail." Originally called a failGET, but upgraded to a semi-decent get after the newfags settled down. The thread also marked the return of Yami, who got 50557755, a collection of five fives. A win in the eyes of most of /a/, especially compared to the fail of their recent 8888888 GET. /b/ was not amused.

=== 51 Million ===
; 51M : A box of rogaine that had WHAT? written over it. FailGET properly declared.

=== 56 Million ===
; 56M : An EFG Motivator with EFG standing outside the box, saying "What goes in the box? I don't get it."  Text was "THAT'S WRITE MOTHERFUCKERS, IM GONNA GET IT! 57M GET!"  This is largely considered WINGET.

=== 68 Million ===
; 68888888 : [[Image:68888888.get.jpg|80px|68888888: gets are for fags]] Text ''"gets are for fags"''.

; 80M : [[Image:80 million get.jpg|80px|80M: epic win]] An epic GET which contained text and an image.

; 81M : Javascript spam code; considered the worst GET ever until 100M occured.

; 100M : [[Image:100m_get.jpg|80px|100M: propably a epic fail GET]] FURRY GET, obviously considered an FAILGET; /b/'s header was later changed to express this.

; 123456789 : [[Image:123456789_get.jpg|80px|123456789: get?]] On March 13, 2009. 123456789 post (in /b/) said: "get?". Many threads came up saying it was a fail, and a couple minutes after the get, the thread was 404'd.

; 200000000 : February 21, 2010, 15:19:20 EST. Official art of Ninetales with the text "IT WILL BE MINE! BELONG TO NINETAILS GET". About 650 posts before the get, posts could no longer be made on /b/. Shortly after, the main page went down. A few minutes later, posts could be made again, but the last three digits on each post were replaced with XXX.
