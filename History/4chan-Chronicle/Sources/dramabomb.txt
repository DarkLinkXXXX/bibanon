    "hey look at our TOTALLY ORIGINAL IDEA that NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE."
    Here we've been FOR MONTHS and no one seems to remember.

    That and their trip codes don't work.  That's a sign of suckage if I
    ever saw one.  ALSO, it looks like they went and translated the code for
    the futaba imgboard without realizing that it's already been done (albiet
    partially) by world2ch.  That or they ripped us off.  Either way: Fuckers.

    Sorry about the double post. The child porn in their "random" forum is making me nauseous.

22 Name: 0037 @A0z7CY5eG2 : 10/02/2003 13:15UTC ID:k4KSMCJ6 By Other Language (Permelink)
    Wait... wait... I get it, you're crazy.  Dude, chill.
    "Yaoi and dickgirlz" is there because it's funny.  ADTRW is certainly not
    a hentai forum.  Once again, you're crazy.  There's going to be plenty of
    warring because they stole world2ch's idea and possibly its code without
    the least bit of recognition.  They could have said anything mentioning
    world2ch's [sub-par] efforts and I would have been cool with it.  The thing
    that has infuriated me the most is that they seem to think they have an
    absolutely original idea and it most certainly is not.
    Now relax and think of some better ways to photo-insult 4chan because I'm
    out of ideas.  

23 Name: 0037 @A0z7CY5eG2 : 10/02/2003 13:22UTC ID:k4KSMCJ6 By Other Language (Permelink)
    Wait.  moot says this: "2chan knows all and answers all, and even with world2ch and translators,
    I still can't get my questions answered or partake in SMILEY WARS... "
      
    So we were mentioned... So I drop a few accusations.   This doesn't mean I'm not bitter, though.
      
    One more thing:  The greatest opportunity lies before us.  If we can draw attention to ourselves,
    world2ch might live.

    Yeah, it's technically legal, but I don't think anyone other than Apis would allow it on their 
    section of the Web. Bad luck :(
      
    So, the "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse" is actually non-hentai. Why do they stand for that
    name? If I had to pay $10 to register for forums, Nazi moderation and general stupidity would not
    be a good deal for my money.

    That and Lowtax & Cronies are suspected of thinking anime is gay.  The tentacle

    SA's anime nerds.  That and it's FUNNY if you have a sense of humor about it.

    2chan image boards without running across stuff even more despicable than

36 Name: moot: 10/02/2003 21:31UTC ID:??? By Other Language (Permelink)
    I'll try to address each post, sorry if I miss one.
      
    First I'd like to thank you all for not contacting me via email, and
    hiding behind this world2chan alliance thingy that was formed. I
    really do stress that importance of MAILING me and voicing concerns. Hats
    off to those that read further than the sarcastic quote on the main page.
      
    >>1 First of all, you've obviously never read or been a part of the SA forums.
    ADTRW is only a small fraction of SA's community, and 99% of the members
    will gladly argue it is well worth the $10, if not more.
      
    >>6 This is a reply to six and the others posts following it. 4chan is
    not ADTRW only , in fact I wanted it to be broader. The reason ADTRW
    currently encompasses the board is the fact that they're actually posting,
    and not brooding up half-witted anti-4chan remarks here. ADTRW is also
    the only board I posted 4chan on, as some of the members helped me out.
      
    Let me also stress the stuff written on the SA main page, has almost nothing
    to do with the mentality and members of the forums. Two completely
    different worlds guys.
      
    >>16 Correct! I didn't even know futaba was public until I had fully translated
    Gazou myself. After that I edited the entire code MYSELF(hova helped),
    as I had no clue the 0ch script even "existed". Good way to draw up accusations!

    to post here rather than contact me, telling me that this post existed, and that
    you have in fact "declared war".
      
    >>18 4chan has nothing to do with SA, other than the fact I posted it there.
    It's not some sort of super secret ADTRW conspiracy to bring world2ch down,
    sorry :( The only people who have helped out so far, have actually
    e-mailed me! What a surprise, I actually read e-mails (HINT).
      
    >>19 About the motto. Sarcasm, you've heard of it right? For lack of
    a better motto, I stuck that up there. I guess I'll have to change it
    for some of our slower friends.
      
    >>21 Stop using "their" please, thanks. That board was merely the first thing
    I stuck up. I do not care if it becomes a shitfest, as it will be taken
    down when I find people to moderate (read: NAZI BAN) the serious anime boards.
    Moderation is the only way we can keep this evil evil pedo hentai out, because
    we all know ADTRW is a bunch of 40 year old pedophiles who have nothing better
    to do than look at pictures of women and children with penises!
      
    >>22 I'm sorry that I failed to give world2ch enough credit. Why did I not?
    Frankly I don't use these boards much, other than an occasional view or two, and
    yes, all of the coding was edited by myself and hova. I actually flipped out
    on IRC after someone informed me futaba was public. What a waste of work...

    There is no "wing" of SA, or conspiracy to only use him as a host. He offers
    MANY services for members and provides reliable hosting, that is the reason
    I chose him to host 4chan.
      
    >>27 ADTRW, is again, and sarcastic (and quite humourous in the eyes of many),
    name for a forum. Most of the admins/moderators do not enjoy anime, in fact
    the majority of SA despises the SUB-forum. We are our own community.

    Thank you for insulting me without ever speaking with me. I look forward
    to having a real two way conversation with you in the future. There must
    be a few people here that agree insulting boards that you have never used, is
    incredibly stupid.
      
    >>32 I'll change it if I must appease worldch.

    That should be everything. I again stress contacting me if you have concerns,
    flames, or praise for the site. Posting angsty threads on a small corner of the

    Feel free to rip me apart/whatever, this wasn't a "pro-SA world2ch SUCKS LET'S

    To clarify any such ambiguities that may arise:
    1) We host adult content, we host several adult-content laden sites.  Does it perturb 
    us?  No, not really.
    2) We're not the only HSP out there for SA, we actually do have
    competition and while we have a large market share of users from SA,
    it is not the crux.  We aren't under the wing and there isn't some
    massive conspiracy out there.
    3) I hate anime personally, it's an obligation we deferred to moot.
    4) Please, before you attempt to dispatch another e-mail from a
    username of 'Spam Is Tasty', please be aware of what pornography
    is, our stance, and what is art.  Certainly, you can construe, as
    a nimble-minded individual, anime as blatant pornography of naked
    animals and other weird incongruities with normal human society,
    but then again, it is art work.  I shall now kindly paste what
    I received this morning regarding 4chan:
      
    A website which you appear to be hosting, http://img.4chan.net/b/ ,
    is in my opinion violating your Acceptable Use Policy. If you browse
    through its the archives, you will see many uploaded pictures that
    are definitely pornographic and involving children (albeit technically
      not *illegal* child porn), as well as some other rather gruesome
    pictures.
      
      
    Please - I stress - read through our Acceptable Use Policy.  Read
    through our 'Resource Center', then fire an e-mail off.
      
    As a concluding thought: do NOT write an e-mail trying to make an
    argument with "in my opinion".  The weakest foundation of an
    argument rests in that clause, be assertive and don't use a
    fictional name.

    for you (consult it for the bit on trip codes).

    And now a note to no one in particular:
    Look at this place.  We have upwards of six users.  We have about twenty boards
    two of which people post in on a regular basis.  And even then, it's never any-
    thing worth reading.  Our admin doesn't speak English and continues to add use-
    less features, all the while subtracting useful ones.
    That which appealed to me was the fact that, if you're careful, no one short of
    the government has any idea who you are when you post on world2ch.  Here you're
    free to discuss whatever you like, drama it up and you can't track it back in
    your house.  I'm hoping 4chan can continue this tradition of anonynomity [and
    drama].

    I'm all for 4chan being a 'real' alternative to 2ch. I'm certainly enjoying it right 
    now. But I really hope they add some actual BBS's instead of just imgboards. (not that 
    I'm complaining about the imgboards :3)
      
    I found world2ch only a few days ago, hoping it would be an understandable version of 
    the awesome that is 2ch. Like you said, though, this place is rarely frequented, and 
    even then it's mediocre, at best.

    fresh (ALIVE) community.
      
    Everyone is welcome as long as they don't start trouble (aside from
    a flame (read: suggestion) board that may go up soon.

    What non-image boards would you guys want/recommend? Need some
    topics before I can make them.

    >>52 moot, I'm going to e-mail you with some code samples to show you where
    it's done.  For everyone else who doesn't know this is the deal with trip
    codes:
      
    My name on every reply shows up as:  0037 @A0z7CY5eG2
      
    That last part is a trip code.  It's a measure (while not a bullet-proof one)
    to ensure that replies are from a unique user.  In the "Name" box you type in
    name#text_string and the system will spit out name@crypted_jibberish. So, it's
    kind of like a password.  # results in a self-cap (sorry, I'm spouting out 2ch
    lingo but I can't help it).  If you're chums with admin you can request an
    official cap which is entered name!text_string and results in a nice
    name?crypted_gibberish.
      
    This might feel a little lame, but just to show you how useful it is, I'll
    provide an example...  

55 Name: moot: 10/03/2003 04:36UTC ID:??? By Other Language (Permelink)
    I love Dragonball Z.

56 Name: 0037 @A0z7CY5eG2 : 10/03/2003 04:37UTC ID:KxTHFiNo By Other Language (Permelink)
    And that's how trip codes can be useful.
    This ends today's lessons, class. Read up on chapter two for tomorrow's
    discussion.

    >>53 ASCII art.  A place for people to share weird flash stuff.  Also something
    FYAD-like where people can be idiots in peace.

    >>53 Yes, I was gonna say, definately an AA bored. I lurv my monas. =)
      
    Of course, an anime/manga board as well, maybe a J-pop one. Possibly a Japanese culture/language 
    one? I dunno, maybe I'm pushing it there. I thought I'd have more ideas, but I can't seem to think
    of any right now, heh.

59 Name: moot: 10/03/2003 06:14UTC ID:??? By Other Language (Permelink)
    Great suggestions, will try to implement in the upcoming days. Just
    got done updating some rules/pages/and added a random image PHP script.

    Menchi.  Seriously, what is with this whole persecuted anime fan bit?
    You seem incredibly, -incredibly- oversensitive.  I'm not flaming you,
    here.  It's just that this pose of offense and humorlessness you're
    taking does not make you look good.  For serious, you sound like a
    furry.

    Damn. I was hoping this was going to somehow boil down to an epic battle between
    ricequeen and I with lightsabers and "Duel of the Fates" playing in the background...

    The moderator on SA's anime subforum.  I guess that means you're not from
    SA or at least you don't frequent ADTRW.  I thought this whole place was
    colonized entirely by SA.  You learn something new every day, eh?

    I'm going to make a strange suggestion.  Have you considered off-shore solutions
    to your problem?  http://world2ch.net/test/read.cgi/accuse/1065027993/14n
    Hosting might be cheaper in Japan.  Might be a good idea since that's where all
    of your users are coming from, anyway.
