It turned out this announcement had been made without moot's knowledge, and within a day all boards returned to normal.
* July 28, near midnight, /b/ reached its two millionth post.
* October 16, /b/ reached its three millionth post. The 3,000,000th post has a file with a UNIX timestamp after the 3,000,001st, which has caused some users to believe it was faked.

* February 18, /b/ reached its 5 millionth post, it was a picture of a meme called TowerCat. The 5000001st post was an excerpt from a manga page, which showed MC Hammer saying his catchphrase "Stop! Hammer Time!". Those who did not like TowerCat claimed that this was the true 5milGET.

The 6MGET posted shortly after was Bill Frist pointing at a card. This, as with 5M GET, was disputed as a FAIL GET and post 5999999, an asian man making a creepy face whose teeth seem too large for his mouth was claimed as the true 6M GET. The accompanied text of this picture was also "Hey kid I'm a carborator."
