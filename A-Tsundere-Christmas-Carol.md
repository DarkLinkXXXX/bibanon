**A Tsundere Christmas Carol** is a heartwarming story posted every Christmas Day to 4chan's /a/ since 2011. The author is unknown.

## Original Story

(needs to be archived and put into Github Pages and the [eBookGenerator](https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-eBookGenerator)... maybe put it on the [Github VN repo](https://github.com/bibanon/a-tsundere-christmas-carol) as a special project... well, let's do it later)

## Fanart and Derivative Works

Need to collect any fanart that was made about this...

### Visual Novel

The first Ren'Py [visual novel rendition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7WYx7u6HJh_ZGZiTkJHeHg0YVU/view?usp=sharing) of this story [has been worked on since 2011.](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13155) That one was not completely finished, probably due to lack of interest over the years.

However, after the huge publicity following the 2014 /a/ sticky, one anon updated that VN with a better mod, and released a finalized 1.0 version. The author is anonymous, but seems to have named themselves **VNAnon**. Thanks a lot, man.
