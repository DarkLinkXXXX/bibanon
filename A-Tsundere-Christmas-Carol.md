### Visual Novel

A Ren'Py visual novel rendition of this story [has been worked on since 2011.](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=13155) After the huge publicity following the 2014 /a/ sticky, the author decided to rush and release a finalized 1.0 version. The author is anonymous, but seems to have named themselves **VNAnon**. Thanks a lot 

It has been archived at the Bibliotheca Anonoma Google Drive (will probably upload to Internet Archive later) and can be downloaded from the links below.

(Maybe we will produce a Github repo and website for this... if we can contact the author about it... though then again we should just build it like we did for Hydrus.)
