Originally, this anonymite's posts were archived by Sarafan and his other well-wishers on [[Wikichan]], but that site was shut down and it's hard disk wiped due to poor administration. Thankfully, the story can be read here at the Bibliotheca Anonoma through the hard work of [[Shii]], a kind visitor, and the author himself.
