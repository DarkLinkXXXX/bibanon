## /qa/ - Moot's Livestream Questions and Answers

Many boards mourned the loss, some celebrated, but one thing that anons on /qa/ did was <s>pretend to be an oldfag</s> open up their image folders, recreate classic 4chan threads, and share the great stories people had shared over the years.

The /qa/ board was deactivated three days after the stream ended, to the chagrin of anons who welcomed the temporary "worksafe /b/".
