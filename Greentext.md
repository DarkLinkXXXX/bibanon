**Greentext** is a stream-of-consciousness poetic artform, unique to 4chan, that is designed to put the user in the speaker's point of view. It's as if a person created a core dump of their thoughts during a point in their lifetime, and that shift in viewpoint is almost akin to reading a text adventure from the 1980s. 

It's a very easy and accessible literary form that makes it possible for storytellers to post their tale without going through typical narrative structure or long verbal imagery.

It is characterized by the use of `>` quote markers, which turns text green, the lack of capitalization or periods, a starting command stating _"be me, some kind of anon with certain characteristics"_ and a first-person tense that puts the reader in the author's shoes.

## Addition Guide

Because Markdown interprets `>` as a quote, just as it's normally used for, (and Markdown concatenates lines, which gets really annoying), special transformations are needed to post greentext here. 

But don't worry, we've created a [Greentext to Markdown converter](http://www.regexr.com/3aflp).

1. Open the [Greentext to Markdown converter](http://www.regexr.com/3aflp).
2. Paste your greentext in the "Text" box.
3. Copy the converted result from the "Substitution" box, and paste it in this wiki.
  * A Github account is necessary to edit the wiki.
