### Contribute

We need your help and contribution to succeed. Create a Github account to edit this wiki. Then check out the [[Current Projects]] section if you'd like to start somewhere.

The Bibliotheca Anonoma uses a [Kanban Board system](http://trello.com/bibanon), to coordinate our projects. It's publicly viewable (and commentable), so check our [current progress there.](http://trello.com/bibanon) 

There's also a massive stack of new stories that we still haven't read through in [the Workroom](https://trello.com/b/ohziwjHI/content-to-import). You can comment on it, or toss us any new stories/content in [our thread at Vyrd.net.](http://tb.vyrd.net/net/res/46.html#46)

> We're trying to migrate to [Libreboard](http://libreboard.com) as an alternative to Trello. That way, we can modify it so anonymously toss in a story for us to check out, or even work on it collaboratively.

### Introduction to Internet Culture

The word "culture" holds a connotation of high culture; whatever the winners write in the history books, the artwork in museums that few contemporaries enjoyed, or the literary achievements of an aloof elite. 

But many forget that culture is also defined as the products, the influences, the memes that spring from interaction between any human to another; it manifests in the street, in an organization, through mass media or pop culture, or through smaller subcultures. 

Whether present-day or contemporary society considers such culture moral or immoral, out of fashion or in with the times is irrelevant. Once recorded, that culture *gives us a rare insight into the common thoughts, behaviors, and traditions of the people of that era*; and for that reason alone it is worth saving. 

For the Internet has become more than just another invention of man; it is an alternate reality where most of humanity's interaction and livelihoods take place, and thus influence the physical world. 

Despite this, the important legacy of internet culture is constantly overlooked as a passing fad by both constituents and creators. Soon, new servers will supersede the old, inactive data will fall down the memory hole, and link rot shall destroy cultural context. And it won't be long before a future archivist, sifting through humanity's library of knowledge, curses us for our complacency. 

This is why we have taken up the struggle, however fierce, however unloved or hated, to archive and analyze the history and the products of internet folklife. One that I hope you too will be a part of.

### Internet Subcultures

Internet subcultures have created communities resembling nation-states (many manifesting in websites); with rich traditions, storied history, administration issues, struggles with immigration and emigration, even peaceful and "violent" conflicts. Internet subcultures can evolve drastically, rise and fall in just a matter of months. 

But most importantly, each subculture strongly influences any successor, given that their constituents are still alive and active. Even the tinest events can become pivotal in the future through the Butterfly Effect.

Thus, the internet no longer merely collects ideas and cultural output, it's subcultures are initiating projects, concepts and events that have real world implications. Silicon Valley's Hacker Mentality (Google, Apple, Facebook), the Free/Libre Open Source Software Movement (creating Linux, Apache, Firefox, Android), internet memes, the modding community, Anonymous, the Arab Spring, all prove that internet history strongly affects the human condition in the Information Age.
