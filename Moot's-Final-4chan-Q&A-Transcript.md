> **Note:** _This ambitious document was made possible by the hard work of [many nameless anons at this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pL3LmKIb6Q25LGzO3GwNqgGOAjQnrCasdMULVpwF4vw/edit#); who gave their time to slog through 8-hours of transcripts from YouTube's robot-automated speech recognition system._

Moot made a historically significant [farewell livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYUKJBZuUig) about the Past, Present, and Future of 4chan. 

This 8-hour Livestream holds **new information on the early days of 4chan**, **farewell recommendations for anons**, and discussion on issues from around internet history.

A transcript is critical for anons who require text access (visual or auditory impairments), anons who want to skim 8 hours of rambling speech in a condensed document (with the power of Ctrl-F) or even translation to other languages. (at least through google translate)

*Because hey, anyone can anon too, even your dog.* 

> _\>and the day will come when a newfag asks, "who is moot"?_

Most of all, Moot's speeches are the end-all be-all primary sources for the [[4chan Chronicle]], as the first and longest-serving anon in it's history.
