Moot made a historically significant [farewell livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYUKJBZuUig) about the Past, Present, and Future of 4chan. 

This 8-hour Livestream holds **new information on the early days of 4chan**, **farewell recommendations for anons**, and discussion on issues from around internet history.

A transcript is critical for anons who require text access (visual or auditory impairments), anons who want to skim 8 hours of rambling speech in a condensed document (with the power of Ctrl-F) or even translation to other languages. (at least through google translate)

* **00:00:41** Alright, now we get to learn why I’m not a radio announcer. Mic check in front of  24 thousand people, so yeah.
* **00:00:54** Thanks for joining for what is going to be the final Q&A or PMQ as we used to call them with 4chan, and y’know hopefully I think it’s an opportunity for you all to roast me or... oh god, I hear myself in the background now.
* **00:01:12** okay, um, yeah, just gonna kinda say our goodbyes and y’know ask any questions, and I’ll try to respond to as many of those questions as I can, and you know, as honestly and as thoroughly as possible
* **00:01:29** and so let’s begin.
* **00:01:30** So I’m if you’re not checking the Q&A board, just go to… I’m not going to use the hangouts feature to take questions, and comments are disabled on both the stream and hangouts on the youtube page, and so go to
* **00:01:45**  boards.4chan.org/qa and one of the moderators has put up a sticky which has already 1500 posts, this is gonna take forever, it’s good to see the last time I did one of these, I spent 4 hours doing it, I don’t expect to do it that long this time around, but that was the limit, now there’s an 8 hour limit, so I guess we can go for a marathon maybe.
* **00:02:06** So the stickies will be capped off and kinda rotated out and so if that sticky is locked, then go to the next one. The unlocked sticky is where you should be asking your questions.
* **00:02:20** Ah, okay, so the first question, pretty straight shooter, number 520.
* **00:02:25** When did you feel you were losing touch with the userbase?
* **00:02:28** I mean It’s hard to ask, first of all it assumes that I have lost touch, which I guess most of my detractors will loudly claim.
* **00:02:38** But I founded 4chan when I was 15, which obviously means my interests have changed since then. I mean, when I was 15 I used to basically sit on  my computer all day every day, and I more or less still do that, although then I used to 
* **00:02:51** read Something Awful and spend a lot of time in chatrooms and IRC, watching a lot of anime, and that’s kinda how 4chan came to be 
* **00:03:01** these days I spend a lot of time on my computer, but seem to mostly be wasting my time on the internet, just poking around, reading the news, reading my email
* **00:03:13** I have a much more boring existence, and as /a/ knows, I don’t watch as much anime any more. I still play games, on occasion, I might play a few games a year.
* **00:03:25** I’m afraid to name my choices in games cause /v/ will probably shit all over them, but I played GTA online earlier this year, The Last of Us, a few iPhone games, I’m still trying to beat Hyper Hexagonest on the iPhone, but y’know, again, my interests have shifted over the years, 
* **00:03:45** And so I guess that, you know, to some of the kind of older users and kinda die-hards, the fact that I am not as kinda up to speed with anime and video games and whatnot has kinda been interpreted as I've kinda forsaken, I guess, the early community, but I would just say my preferences have shifted
* **00:04:10** And again, my responsibility and kind of role over the years has been to, you know, act in the best interests of the community at large and the website and I think that, despite the fact that, maybe I don't, have the same interests I had when I was younger, I've always acted in a way that I think has served the greater community which I think speaks to, kind of a larger, uh, rift over the years is that a lot of people I think kind of fail to appreciate how large 4chan is, and how varied the boards are, and how varied the demographic of users are, and you know, sometimes, [pause]
* **00:04:55** You know, that's actually one of the reasons we implemented the unique, uh, users and threads just to give people an idea of how many people are actually participating in a thread, but I think that a lot of people sometimes interpret their own world view or their own opinions or views about their board or the site and whatnot as the canonical view and kinda fail to appreciate that there are more stakeholders than just themselves, just the threads they like, just the board that they like. I mean again,  about maybe 2 million people will post on 4chan in, you know,  any given month, and about 20 million
* **00:05:31** People browse it. I mean, that’s just  gigantic, right? And you know, if you go back and read these old newsposts that I used to make, there’s one called “Full House” that .. I kinda pointed out that 4chan has kinda come to serve a gajillion people since its inception.
* **00:05:48** And we’ve updated the software, obviously, and we’ve added various features that have kinda helped to scale it to a larger audience, but at the end of the day the basic format of the boards and the way that threads work hasnt changed in 11+ years. 
* **00:06:02** And so we’re accomodating 20 million+ people with about, I think it’s 64 boards, and there are certain limitations on how well that’ll work. You tend to see kind of a decrease in quality as post rate goes up. People have just this very specific view of the site, how it’s being managed and whatnot, depending on where they’re browsing, and fail to appreciate that it’s a lot of people under one roof who have their own different views and own different wants and needs.   
* **00:06:46** The challenge in any sort of administrative role is to serve as many people as possible as best you can. So, that’s been the goal. Let’s see...
* **00:07:00** “Are the rumors of you selling out to the SJWs true? Tell us why /pol/ has turned into the new /b/.” I’m sure I’ll get this question a thousand times today. I don’t understand what that question means. But no, I have not sold out to the social justice warriors. As far as I can tell, no one really identifies with that term, but that is the boogieman of the moment.
* **00:07:24** “Can you tell us why /pol/ has turned into the new /b/?”No real reason other than I decided to harken back to old 4chan fun. I think it did actually kind of serve a purpose to drive off a certain percentage of the userbase for the better, and I do think that the flags and IDs actually have increased the quality of the board.
* **00:07:51** It’s still more or less been moderated [accuracy?] in terms of what content is removed. Really the only things that tend to be removed are blatantly off-topic things, but I have poked around /pol/ since its inception and I would say on the whole it’s better today than it has been in the past. 
* **00:08:12** Again, I’m sure that you could find a thousand people that’ll disagree with me.
* **00:08:19** So number 541 “Why not just delete /tv/ at this point?” This is a huge question, and more of a statement. Let’s see...I don’t really need to read the stance on this, but why would we delete it? Tens of thousands of people use it. Just because you don’t like it or like its current form doesn’t mean that those tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands- in fact, I can actually pull up analytics, I should probably have that up.  You know, just because you don’t like it, again 4chan is the epitome of “stop liking what I don’t like”, and if you don’t like it, then going back to the age-old advice of  don’t browse it, hide and delete, or rather hide and report.
* **00:09:06** But if you have a concrete suggestion as to what exactly to change, in the past I’ve always welcomed this by email. I very rarely get constructive feedback other than, you know, “Go die in a fire” or “xyz sucks” or “Fire such-and-such mod” or “Ban this user”. And so… If you had concrete suggestions.. But I feel like the people that complain about a board  are usually- unless there’s a real objective problem that exists which every user of the board is facing, which are difficult to find because again, your interpretation of how things are is very much based on your own view and is not largely representative of the view held by the majority of users. 
* **00:10:00** But these types of things are kind of hard to resolve, so I don’t know if I’ll be able to please you. 
* **00:10:05** So /tv/, for example, is visited by 476,000 people in a month or the last 30 days at least, and served 13.7 million page views. And so again if you can find consensus among those 450,000+ people then be my guest. You know, you could probably do a better job with it than I could.  
* **00:10:28** Do you still hate /pol/? # 567? No I don't hate /pol/, I don't hate anything on 4chan, I don’t hate anybody. I find that it is a lot of work to hate strangers on the internet and don’t tend to spend my time doing that.

### 0:10 - 0:20

* **00:10:43** Who is going to be the new head admin replacing you? # 573 Are there any other chans other than 4chan that you visit? Why did you stop lifting?
* **00:10:51** New admin? I kinda answered this in the news post that I posted. There is no head admin per se replacing me. I mean I've more or less been the only real “administrator” as far as the only decision-maker/leader/manager/whatnot 4chan has ever had. That's not a role that is going to be filled immediately. In the interim there are three people that I didn’t name by name but I described their roles in that post.
* **00:11:26** So, one is the lead developer. Most people know this person already if you dig around for it but he's been helping out for about two years now and and he wrote the native extension, the javascript extension. 
* **00:11:43** It’s more of the less all the backend development what not for the better part of two years now and he is excellent when he runs the catalog there or the unofficial catalog rather. He made our [???] and he’s great.
* **00:11:54** The other is the server admin, out of every man who has been helping out for actually over 10 years. Well maybe not [all time] but he’s the oldest volunteer that’s still serving. He's been incredible over the years, he was once the lead developer and [even as] we all have a real life and real job now, he always continued to pitch in and help with the servers and stuff  so we're very lucky to have him.
* **00:12:31** And the last is that managing moderator, who is the person that I delegated a lot of the HR roles to over the past year. Believe it or not there is a very real orientation process, in terms of going through the janitor applications and doing orientation, and rule clarifications and being present on the team channel and on the Janitor channel and you know on 4chan, blablabla...
* **00:13:04** He's taking a very active role in the day-to-day management of the team volunteers that we have  He surfaces the problems that needed my attention to me, so he's also done a really a excellent job. [In the long-term], there’s not some group of [people] that are the “end all be all” administrators.
* **00:13:36** I haven’t named those people yet [or] decided what to do about that. In the short term, nothing should change from a user's perspective., [Classifying them] isn't fair to the other team members, The three core team members, who are the three minimum set of  people I need to ensure a smooth transition, have all decided to pitch in .
* **00:13:57** Are there any other chans you visit? Actually, because people ask me this a lot: Obviously I visit other websites. I visited other imageboards over the years but I don't actively use any, because 4chan is a handful, [it] already has all of my interest represented on it. There's not really a compelling reason to use other web sites. 
* **00:14:23** I'm sure I’ll have an opportunity to do this later but, I actually did want to give a shout out to kirtainer (who runs 420chan) [who sent me an email that said] ‘hey, it's been forever’, a day or two ago. To single out 420chan, it’s actually one of the imageboards that I have actually respected over the years. I think that what's kind of defined a lot of image boards, even going back to the first kind of spin off from 4chan (which was 5Chan), 7chan and all these others. They tend to spin out based on a decision I make, or they don’t like me, or they don’t like 4chan, or they don’t like 4chan culture or whatever. More or less over the years, most of those sites have kind of fizzled out.
* **00:15:10** While 420Chan started similarly to 5chan, (the admin didn’t like me), I really respect that he wanted to have a bunch of topics that 4chan didn’t have but 420Chan  essentially [made] into being because it was like:
* **00:15:24** “Hey, 4chan is never  gonna have a drugs board, or a wrestling board, or all these other boards that I want, and so we may as well create a site that caters to that.” 
* **00:15:33** I really respect the fact that he really took it in its  own direction, it doesn't look like 4chan. The other sites [based on] Kusaba X (SP) created a whole era of open source clones of 4chan that offered 4chan in a box and emulated our front page and everything. People, for whatever reason wanted to make 4chan that wasn’t 4chan.
* **00:15:55** He really kind of made it his own. (I think he had another administrator at one point.) So i’ve actually been a huge fan [of 420chan].
* **00:16:03** Although I've never done a narcotic drug, I’ve never smoked weed or anything like that (I never really had a reason to use it), I don’t watch wrestling either (sorry
/sp/ or /asp/), I’ve always actually really respected that site. So, it’s good to see that there are people trying to do neat things out there. 
* **00:16:23** Why did I stop lifting? I stopped lifting probably about a year ago. But I actually stopped going to the gym last September. I think I have it in my phone, actually my last like update on my note was like in September 9th or 10th. 
* **00:16:40** That was a result of The Fappening, because of the emotional and kind of physical toll that that took on me. I mean September was a really rough month. I mean we started it with The Fappening, (you’d have to be under a rock to not know what that is)
* **00:16:58** One day, August 30th or 31st. or September 1st, I think we served about 93 million page views in one day. Over the month of September (which
doesn't include late August traffic) we served 45
million unique visitors and about 980 or so million page views, the closest we ever got to doing a billion page views. 
In a normal month 4chan will serve about 20 to 22 million unique visitors and about 500 million page views a month (now it's actually closer
to 610-615.)
* **00:17:28** Actually we probably did do a billion just given that so many people, like all of our friends on /g/ block Google Analytics (aka Google botnet). Analytics is not always the best [statistic]. So that month we probably did break a billion page views.
* **00:17:57** I was just completely overwhelmed. We got many a legal nastygram from obviously all the firms representing the actresses. We spent a shit load of time on the phone with lawyers, and it cost us tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills. I'm so glad that I’ve done such a good job saving over the years because that on a bad day could have easily bankrupted the site. 
* **00:18:25** What else did we have that month? That was when /pol/ was doing the ebola jam too. [And] I guess that was when Gamergate began to find its mainstream audience.
* **00:18:43** Anyway, September was this long, long, long month. I just was so
overwhelmed dealing with all that stuff that I stopped lifting then and I actually haven’t been back to the gym since.
* **00:18:54** Have you installed Gentoo? # 574. I actually did install Gentoo a long
time ago on a really old laptop. I believe it finished compiling but I never actually really used it for anything.
* **00:19:09** I’m just gonna start skimming through
these ‘cause there are probably already thousands of questions already. 
* **00:19:13** Is /s4s/ still your favorite board? /jp/ is actually my favorite board according to what I said at the 10th anniversary panel a year and a half ago. [sarcasm] 
* **00:19:26** But [anyway], I really like /s4s/ a lot. I mean, I like all the boards. I’ve actually been spending a lot of time on /o/. DBT is one of my favourite threads these days, even though they’re pretty silly.
* **00:19:37** Trying to think of what else.
* **00:19:41** Yeah, I actually browse /a/ a lot (despite that they all flip their shit when I post) but it’s still actually a fun board. I mean, I would say again, for all the people that complain about /a/’s quality and blah blah blah, and Naruto threads, /a/ is really actually
truly one of the best boards.

### 0:20 - 0:30

* **00:20:00** I’ll look at the stats really quickly but /a/ is huge. I mean, it has historically been the third largest board, but maybe it's the fourth largest now.
* **00:20:10** You know, /a/ is very large. And despite the fact that it receives a lot of
posts, its quality tends to be quite high.
* **00:20:21** So let's see. The first sticky is already dead and I'm only like two questions in. I
guess we will be here for eight hours today.
* **00:20:28** /a/ is used by 850 or so thousand users alone per month and
serves about 23.5 million page views. For everybody who uses /a/, you now know that you have almost a million buddies.
* **00:20:47** #589 When did you decide to quit? It feels like you made a decision a while ago, at least a year or two ago. There are a lot of questions in here. But, I mean, I’ve said that in interviews and I think I said that on the news post, but again the announcement that I made on Wednesday is a long time coming. I mean it really wasn’t so much a matter of ‘if’ but rather ‘when’.
* **00:21:10** It had been on my mind for a long time and it really kinda entered
my [mind] probably about eight or nine months before the 10th [anniversary of 4chan].
* **00:21:22** I actually had this in my news post but I took it out.
* **00:21:26** You know, one of the questions I've gotten over the years (besides, ‘fuck you’, which really isn’t a question) is “What happens to 4chan if you die?”
* **00:21:37** I used to joke that, “Oh well I guess. My mother is next of kin so it would go to
her, and you’d have Mama Moot baking you some cookies,” or whatnot. (I’m kidding my mom doesn’t bake)
* **00:21:49** All joking aside, the prospect for the site would be very grim. I am the, again, sole owner, sole manager, sole administrator. I own the company. I own all the hardware. I have every single password, 
* **00:22:05** It’s always really funny to see conspiracy theories that exist about moderators and leaks and whatnot. Or how people seem to think that there's this cabal of SJW moderators managing the site, but 4chan’s hierarchy is essentially
completely flat.
* **00:22:27** Volunteer Moderators (Janitors) are at the bottom, then the Moderators, General Managers, and then myself. The General Manager position didn't exist until about a year or so ago, as a result of kind of my succession planning.
* **00:22:42** But… that's it. Whenever I see there’s been some really funny fake chat logs over the years and it’s always hilarious because I don't actually talk in the IRC channels that often. I don't consult moderators or janitors. I don’t share my thinking. 
* **00:23:01** In that sense I've been a pretty bad people manager. It's not a committee, it's not consensus driven at all. It’s really just I make decisions and sometimes communicate to them. A lot of the time they’re pretty much completely in the dark. I barely use IRC these days.
* **00:23:17** So every time I see those chat logs I laugh because… Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the channels are silent a lot of the time.
* **00:23:26** Anyway, the organisation is basically flat with me on top. That’s really unhealthy [once I consider] what should happen to [4chan] if I were to become incapacitated, if I were to get hit by a bus and die, or get a new job, get married, have kids, get burnt out, whatever.
* **00:23:46** All of those things would take me away from the site, [and by] a certain point in time, probably would have ensured 4chan’s death.
* **00:23:59** I've kind of joked in these interviews that… it's the opposite of that saying, ‘the captain shall go down with his ship’.
* **00:24:09** But this was like ‘The ship goes down with the captain.’ The second I take a step off the ship, the ship would implode. [Clearly], no ship should be designed that way.
* **00:24:17** So that's what kind of got me thinking about, well, how do I… how do I change that. And actually as it turns out, I wrote a news post in February of last year that I never posted (I just discovered it a few days ago), when I was about to publish the Wednesday announcement. 
* **00:24:36** [It] alluded to this very directly. “Next year, what I'm focused on is finding out how to make 4chan outlast me.” I had realized that the site would basically die without me. Long term planning came to my mind after 4chan hit our 10th anniversary, just because I never expected… no, nobody expected 4chan to make it 10 years, much less continue chugging on.
* **00:25:02** When 4chan turned five or six, I would think only about the year ahead. I’d think ‘Okay, what do I want to do next year?’ Are we gonna make it to six or seven?’
* **00:25:16** Once you hit ten, your frame of reference completely changes. It’s so inconceivable, that you make it to ten you begin to think, ‘Well, maybe it's not inconceivable that we’ll make it to twenty.’
* **00:25:29** And… I can’t... it's hard to name any website that I use that are twenty years, even ten years old. It really is an unprecedented milestone. And even then… for as many people who claim ‘4chan is kill’, [our traffic statistics show that] 4chan still has as much traffic its ever done. Its actually held that amount of traffic for about four or five 
years.
* **00:25:54** It's hard for communities to maintain that standard ‘cause they, you know, [fall apart someday]. So 4chan has peaked, it’s been a 4 or 5 year peak, which i think is actually quite, quite impressive.
* **00:26:08** I’m rambling so I lost my train of thought. But anyway, you know it just became clear to me that if I wanted to make it another ten or twenty years, something needs to change, and that something was me. So I spent the better part of the past year or two just thinking about what needs to change. I wanted to ensure that 4chan makes enough money to support itself.
* **00:26:32** [Just for example, look at] the servers. We've had some issues these past few days, but we upgraded a bunch of the servers. Even though I made this decision so long ago and I was really imminently going to leave weeks ago I mean we spent thousands of dollars upgrading the servers. That’s why he had that down time, you know it wasn’t a DDOS a few weeks ago. People thought it was. We upgraded all the servers and they all have much faster processors now and more RAM.
* **00:26:52** When the site isn't kind of having the hiccups that we've had the past few days it’s blazing fast. I released it's a lot faster and more
stable than it's ever been. For those of you who have been browsing 4chan for
more than a few years, I mean you probably remember how slow and unstable the site would be and it would go down for hours or days at a time and it would just be like you were using a dial up modem, it was that slow.
* **00:27:13** So that's in a good place and again like the team is kind of in its best place now more than ever. I really truly actually feel that it's in the best place to survive without me and so that's why I decided to step down and kind of allow for that to happen, because again it had to happen at some point.
* **00:27:30** Have you ever wanted say something but you couldn’t because of
your position as admin? Um, no not particularly. I guess that’s a pretty simple answer. Let me skim through these now because I’m only like 5 in.
* **00:27:48** What makes a good poster? I guess that’s a pretty good question. We’ve had this thing in the rules, maybe it’s in the FAQ, for a really long time that just said we haven’t accepted donations, and it’s something that people often kind of forget, but you know we used to take donations early in the site’s history from 2003 to 2005, haven't taken a single penny in donation since 2005. I fucking hate donations. Again go to the historical news pages, the news post is titled ‘If only it grew on trees’ where I wrote about the 4chan passes, but I explain some of my logic for hating donations. And I think there’s actually one before that from 2012 that kind of touched on it.
* **00:28:26** Anyway so we've always said because you can’t contribute money, what you contribute is posting right, posting quality threads, uploading images, you know, helping people find the source of something, which I guess you shouldn’t do outside of /r/. I don’t know and I mean it’s just like anything that especially in recent months, it's the people that sit around and whine about how bad 4chan is. Again if you want to say how much I suck, great, so be it. I wish you would do that over email because it really just kind of shits up the board and for as many people that believe we delete all that, we really don’t.
* **00:29:04** The people who kind of complain about how much a board sucks, or a thread sucks, or a user sucks, I mean really aren’t contributing anything. I mean it really just kind of mucks things up far more than just shutting your mouth. The way you address that is [to] drown out the shit post with quality posts or submit feedback or if there's like a real problem that we can actually address as the administration, email it to me.
* **00:29:30** I think it’s like sage, you know, back in the day, the sage or sage bombing threads and spamming and dubs and all of that. The quote unquote user moderation really hasn't worked on 4chan for the better part of the past 10 years once we reached a certain scale. I really kind of dislike the fact that people think that, again, complaining and shitting things up further is somehow better than just either zipping it or again deleting or ignoring, reporting and whatnot.

### 0:30 - 0:40

* **00:30:00** … or again just drowning out the shit with good stuff.  There's really no objective way to kind of say somebody’s a good poster because I mean it’s obviously completely subjective but I think deep down we all kind of know what that is.
* **00:30:15** –laughs- Did you sell the site to Anita Sarkeesian? No. Maybe she can do another Kickstarter and she can raise the money. Knowing you guys, you’d all
probably talk enough about it to actually drive enough traffic to it to maybe actually successfully fund it. Maybe that should be your next effort.
* **00:30:36** Should I check my privilege? Yeah, always. Early and often. Uh let's see. Why does your website suck? That is very old meme, I respect your old memeing.
 * **00:30:48** How are you today? I am great if you can’t tell. I mean that’s another thing I kind of mentioned in a lot of these interviews yesterday, but last year when I shut down my startup which was this four year slog and was kind of an emotional rollercoaster, I was in a good place but it was a bummer. Just a lot of things got compressed into a short span of time in terms of making the decision to shut down the company and helping the employees transition and actually shutting down the operations at the office, all of that. So that kind of left this emotional burden that took a few weeks and months to decompress and work that off.
* **00:31:31** Whereas with 4chan, actually like yesterday or I guess Wednesday when I posted that [newspost] I was actually waiting for the emotions to sneak up on me. Maybe I sound apathetic. I mean it’s really not that. I think I’ve reached a point of zen of sorts. I mean I really truly don't have negative feelings. I mean just in general life. For people who are angry on the internet, I really really honestly truly hope that you one day find the beauty in just not caring about things or just not allowing strangers and things outside of your control to rile you up because it’s a very healthy way to live. I'm sure that you’ll add a few extra years to your life by keeping your heart rate down.
* **00:32:12** Again, I rarely feel negative feelings or angry at this point, and it’s the same for 4chan. I mean I look back and I think I’ve been feeling very nostalgic especially over the past few days just seeing some of the cards people have made me and some of the people linking to the old 4chan.org/flash, flash archive, and just posting old memes and old images and stuff like that and it really just takes me back. A lot of people who probably haven’t used the site for eleven years because I think very few of us have.
* **00:32:47** A decade is just such a hard amount of time to actually think about and it's just incredible. So I think as I can decompress and reflect over the coming weeks I’m sure more of those emotions will surface. But I mean right now I just feel extremely content and satisfied. Just really proud of the community and again the community is unprecedented. There are very few communities that are 4chan’s size. There are much fewer communities that have actually been around for as long as 4chan has and that's incredible. So I’m very glad that I had the privilege to be a part of that. So nothing but positive vibes right now.
* **00:33:31** What do you regret the most? This is actually a  great question. This is #608. A lot of things. Actually I kind of take that back. I mean on one hand I generally don't feel regretting anything is healthy because it’s kind of both eyes forward instead of one or both fixed on the past. You know you can’t change the past, you can only change the future and so it makes a lot more sense to take your energy and invest it in the future and changing those things. I really do believe that life is up and to the right. If you keep your head up and have a good way about you things get better. So I wouldn’t phrase it as regret so much as if I were to go back and change something or if I could possibly change a thing, which again I wouldn't because I think as long as you’re happy in the present and where you are then you have nothing to regret about that. I mean your past can be so shitty but as long as you’re happy today, then you really don't have anything to regret because the shit is what got you to the present. 
* **00:34:39** I’m so happy with where I am now and where the community is. So I don't think I would change anything, but if you know theoretically I were to go back and change something, I think I would’ve headed [or handed? Can’t tell] off this entire issue altogether with my succession by just doing a better job at managing the team from the start and really…there were a lot of people who I think wanted to help out early on and I didn't really give them that opportunity.
* **00:35:06** I really chose to shoulder most of the burden myself over the past eleven and a half years and, you know, I regret that in that I think that if I had kind of more people that I kinda trusted and again empowered early on and kind of treated as partners, it's interesting to you know kind of think about where we could be today or at least I’m sure a lot of the 4chan and life in general are these kind of peaks and valleys and I think having more support from you know a group of people that I really trusted and what not would have kind of smoothed out those peaks and valleys.
* **00:35:44** For a long time I used to describe myself as the loneliest webmaster and that’s because I really didn’t have many friends contrary to popular belief, all these wonderfully wild kind of theories that run about.
* **00:35:59** I am friendly with a lot of the moderators and janitors now as I’ve gotten to know them but they're not my friends, people that are my friends in real life have really never become involved with the site. I mean my friends outside of 4chan don’t use 4chan except for the people who I’ve met through the site.
* **00:36:16** I’ve made a lot of friends through 4chan over the years. At least a few dozen people I’ve met and a handful of very, very close friends I’ve met through 4chan. One or two of those people may be involved with the team, but I met them through 4chan and they were probably involved before I became friends with them.
* **00:36:32** But for a long time I felt very kind of isolated because again like 4chan as a community is kinda peerless and my kinda tenure as an administrator of a giant community for 10+ years is also peerless.
* **00:36:45** I mean it’s hard to name really any other analogous examples and so for a long time there wasn’t anybody, but once we reached a certain point like sure there are other website administrators that were running communities, but  once 4chan got into the millions, tens of millions of users I stopped having people I could ask for advice that at least had kind of first-hand knowledge or experience.
* **00:37:08** And so for a long time I think I kinda chose to go in alone and felt pretty lonely. So I think that had I done a better job at kind of managing the team volunteers then I could have drawn on them for support.  
* **00:37:22** But for whatever reason, I didn’t and again I would just say I was a terrible people manager early on. I was 15, like what does a 15 year old know about managing people? I mean I had my first job when I was 15 or 16 so.
* **00:37:32** I never managed anybody up until pretty recently, four years ago with the start up. I learned a lot about just how to direct people to make them feel appreciated and to know that you value their work and all of that.
* **00:37:52** This isn’t meant to be offensive, but I think a lot of 4channers are probably in their late teens, early twenties and so you may not have had this experience yet in your own careers, you know, leading people or managing people.
* **00:38:05** Just know that people deserve your respect and kindness.
* **00:38:11** Probably the worst thing I’ve done is that I would only really kinda reach out to people when they’ve done something wrong, which is like 1% of the time instead of the 99% of the time that they were doing a great job. It really breeds a pretty toxic work culture and relationship if you act that way.
* **00:38:26** As I’ve kind of grown up and had that first-hand experience I’ve really tried to be better to the moderators, but I have a lot to make up for there.
* **00:38:36** A lot of the users kind of treat them like shit, which, again, is a bummer because they’re all recruited. They’re all you. I mean they all come from the community. At this point the only way to become a moderator is to be a janitor. Only way to be a janitor is to be a 4channer and apply. They all really love the community and all have served it for hours and hours, days’ worth and weeks’ worth of their lives and rarely get thanks.
* **00:39:04** In lieu of receiving that praise from the community, which probably won’t change at this point, I wish I had done a better job at thanking them myself.
* **00:39:12** This is great. This is like very therapeutic. I’m glad we’re doing this. Let’s see.
* **00:39:22** #605. I think what many people are concerned about is who still owns 4chan in the future? I know you said the contrary in the VB interview, but even though you are stepping down as an admin can’t you still own the site just to make sure no one fucks it up to be some kind of plebbit 9fag facebook crap? We need 4chan to be 4chan.
* **00:39:44** As I said in that interview and other related interviews, I do want to completely step back. It’s time. It’s been eleven and a half years. It’s time for not only myself to move on, but the community to move on. I really view it as an opportunity for new leadership or the community to kind of go in a direction that I may not have taken it. For better or worse.
