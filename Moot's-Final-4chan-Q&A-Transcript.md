> **Note:** This ambitious document was made possible by the hard work of [many nameless anons at this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pL3LmKIb6Q25LGzO3GwNqgGOAjQnrCasdMULVpwF4vw/edit#); who slogged through 8-hours of transcripts from YouTube's robot-automated speech recognition system.

Moot made a historically significant [farewell livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYUKJBZuUig) about the Past, Present, and Future of 4chan. This 8-hour Livestream holds information on the early days of 4chan, farewell recommendations for anons, and comments on issues from around internet history.

A transcript is critical for for those who require text access, anons who want to skim 8 hours of speech (with the power of Ctrl-F), or even translation to other languages. *Because hey, anyone can anon too, even your dog.* 

> \>and the day will come when a newfag asks, "who is moot"?

Most of all, Moot's speeches are the end-all be-all primary sources for the [[4chan Chronicle]], as the first and longest-serving anon in it's history.
