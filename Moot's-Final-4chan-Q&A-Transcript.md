Moot made a historically significant [farewell livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYUKJBZuUig) about the Past, Present, and Future of 4chan. 

This 8-hour Livestream holds **new information on the early days of 4chan**, **farewell recommendations for anons**, and discussion on issues from around internet history.

A transcript is critical for anons who require text access (visual or auditory impairments), anons who want to skim 8 hours of rambling speech in a condensed document (with the power of Ctrl-F) or even translation to other languages. (at least through google translate)

*Because hey, anyone can anon too, even your dog.* 

> _\>and the day will come when a newfag asks, "who is moot"?_

Most of all, Moot's speeches are the end-all be-all primary sources for the [[4chan Chronicle]], as the first and longest-serving anon in it's history.

* **00:00:41** Alright, now we get to learn why I’m not a radio announcer. Mic check in front of  24 thousand people, so yeah.
* **00:00:54** Thanks for joining for what is going to be the final Q&A or PMQ as we used to call them with 4chan, and y’know hopefully I think it’s an opportunity for you all to roast me or... oh god, I hear myself in the background now.
* **00:01:12** okay, um, yeah, just gonna kinda say our goodbyes and y’know ask any questions, and I’ll try to respond to as many of those questions as I can, and you know, as honestly and as thoroughly as possible
* **00:01:29** and so let’s begin.
* **00:01:30** So I’m if you’re not checking the Q&A board, just go to… I’m not going to use the hangouts feature to take questions, and comments are disabled on both the stream and hangouts on the youtube page, and so go to
* **00:01:45**  boards.4chan.org/qa and one of the moderators has put up a sticky which has already 1500 posts, this is gonna take forever, it’s good to see the last time I did one of these, I spent 4 hours doing it, I don’t expect to do it that long this time around, but that was the limit, now there’s an 8 hour limit, so I guess we can go for a marathon maybe.
* **00:02:06** So the stickies will be capped off and kinda rotated out and so if that sticky is locked, then go to the next one. The unlocked sticky is where you should be asking your questions.
* **00:02:20** Ah, okay, so the first question, pretty straight shooter, number 520.
* **00:02:25** When did you feel you were losing touch with the userbase?
* **00:02:28** I mean It’s hard to ask, first of all it assumes that I have lost touch, which I guess most of my detractors will loudly claim.
* **00:02:38** But I founded 4chan when I was 15, which obviously means my interests have changed since then. I mean, when I was 15 I used to basically sit on  my computer all day every day, and I more or less still do that, although then I used to 
* **00:02:51** read Something Awful and spend a lot of time in chatrooms and IRC, watching a lot of anime, and that’s kinda how 4chan came to be 
* **00:03:01** these days I spend a lot of time on my computer, but seem to mostly be wasting my time on the internet, just poking around, reading the news, reading my email
* **00:03:13** I have a much more boring existence, and as /a/ knows, I don’t watch as much anime any more. I still play games, on occasion, I might play a few games a year.
* **00:03:25** I’m afraid to name my choices in games cause /v/ will probably shit all over them, but I played GTA online earlier this year, The Last of Us, a few iPhone games, I’m still trying to beat Hyper Hexagonest on the iPhone, but y’know, again, my interests have shifted over the years, 
* **00:03:45** And so I guess that, you know, to some of the kind of older users and kinda die-hards, the fact that I am not as kinda up to speed with anime and video games and whatnot has kinda been interpreted as I've kinda forsaken, I guess, the early community, but I would just say my preferences have shifted
* **00:04:10** And again, my responsibility and kind of role over the years has been to, you know, act in the best interests of the community at large and the website and I think that, despite the fact that, maybe I don't, have the same interests I had when I was younger, I've always acted in a way that I think has served the greater community which I think speaks to, kind of a larger, uh, rift over the years is that a lot of people I think kind of fail to appreciate how large 4chan is, and how varied the boards are, and how varied the demographic of users are, and you know, sometimes, [pause]
* **00:04:55** You know, that's actually one of the reasons we implemented the unique, uh, users and threads just to give people an idea of how many people are actually participating in a thread, but I think that a lot of people sometimes interpret their own world view or their own opinions or views about their board or the site and whatnot as the canonical view and kinda fail to appreciate that there are more stakeholders than just themselves, just the threads they like, just the board that they like. I mean again,  about maybe 2 million people will post on 4chan in, you know,  any given month, and about 20 million
* **00:05:31** People browse it. I mean, that’s just  gigantic, right? And you know, if you go back and read these old newsposts that I used to make, there’s one called “Full House” that .. I kinda pointed out that 4chan has kinda come to serve a gajillion people since its inception.
* **00:05:48** And we’ve updated the software, obviously, and we’ve added various features that have kinda helped to scale it to a larger audience, but at the end of the day the basic format of the boards and the way that threads work hasnt changed in 11+ years. 
* **00:06:02** And so we’re accomodating 20 million+ people with about, I think it’s 64 boards, and there are certain limitations on how well that’ll work. You tend to see kind of a decrease in quality as post rate goes up. People have just this very specific view of the site, how it’s being managed and whatnot, depending on where they’re browsing, and fail to appreciate that it’s a lot of people under one roof who have their own different views and own different wants and needs.   
* **00:06:46** The challenge in any sort of administrative role is to serve as many people as possible as best you can. So, that’s been the goal. Let’s see...
* **00:07:00** “Are the rumors of you selling out to the SJWs true? Tell us why /pol/ has turned into the new /b/.” I’m sure I’ll get this question a thousand times today. I don’t understand what that question means. But no, I have not sold out to the social justice warriors. As far as I can tell, no one really identifies with that term, but that is the boogieman of the moment.
* **00:07:24** “Can you tell us why /pol/ has turned into the new /b/?”No real reason other than I decided to harken back to old 4chan fun. I think it did actually kind of serve a purpose to drive off a certain percentage of the userbase for the better, and I do think that the flags and IDs actually have increased the quality of the board.
* **00:07:51** It’s still more or less been moderated [accuracy?] in terms of what content is removed. Really the only things that tend to be removed are blatantly off-topic things, but I have poked around /pol/ since its inception and I would say on the whole it’s better today than it has been in the past. 
* **00:08:12** Again, I’m sure that you could find a thousand people that’ll disagree with me.
* **00:08:19** So number 541 “Why not just delete /tv/ at this point?” This is a huge question, and more of a statement. Let’s see...I don’t really need to read the stance on this, but why would we delete it? Tens of thousands of people use it. Just because you don’t like it or like its current form doesn’t mean that those tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands- in fact, I can actually pull up analytics, I should probably have that up.  You know, just because you don’t like it, again 4chan is the epitome of “stop liking what I don’t like”, and if you don’t like it, then going back to the age-old advice of  don’t browse it, hide and delete, or rather hide and report.
* **00:09:06** But if you have a concrete suggestion as to what exactly to change, in the past I’ve always welcomed this by email. I very rarely get constructive feedback other than, you know, “Go die in a fire” or “xyz sucks” or “Fire such-and-such mod” or “Ban this user”. And so… If you had concrete suggestions.. But I feel like the people that complain about a board  are usually- unless there’s a real objective problem that exists which every user of the board is facing, which are difficult to find because again, your interpretation of how things are is very much based on your own view and is not largely representative of the view held by the majority of users. 
* **00:10:00** But these types of things are kind of hard to resolve, so I don’t know if I’ll be able to please you. 
* **00:10:05** So /tv/, for example, is visited by 476,000 people in a month or the last 30 days at least, and served 13.7 million page views. And so again if you can find consensus among those 450,000+ people then be my guest. You know, you could probably do a better job with it than I could.  
* **00:10:28** Do you still hate /pol/? # 567? No I don't hate /pol/, I don't hate anything on 4chan, I don’t hate anybody. I find that it is a lot of work to hate strangers on the internet and don’t tend to spend my time doing that.

### 0:10 - 0:20

* **00:10:43** Who is going to be the new head admin replacing you? # 573 Are there any other chans other than 4chan that you visit? Why did you stop lifting?
* **00:10:51** New admin? I kinda answered this in the news post that I posted. There is no head admin per se replacing me. I mean I've more or less been the only real “administrator” as far as the only decision-maker/leader/manager/whatnot 4chan has ever had. That's not a role that is going to be filled immediately. In the interim there are three people that I didn’t name by name but I described their roles in that post.
* **00:11:26** So, one is the lead developer. Most people know this person already if you dig around for it but he's been helping out for about two years now and and he wrote the native extension, the javascript extension. 
* **00:11:43** It’s more of the less all the backend development what not for the better part of two years now and he is excellent when he runs the catalog there or the unofficial catalog rather. He made our [???] and he’s great.
* **00:11:54** The other is the server admin, out of every man who has been helping out for actually over 10 years. Well maybe not [all time] but he’s the oldest volunteer that’s still serving. He's been incredible over the years, he was once the lead developer and [even as] we all have a real life and real job now, he always continued to pitch in and help with the servers and stuff  so we're very lucky to have him.
* **00:12:31** And the last is that managing moderator, who is the person that I delegated a lot of the HR roles to over the past year. Believe it or not there is a very real orientation process, in terms of going through the janitor applications and doing orientation, and rule clarifications and being present on the team channel and on the Janitor channel and you know on 4chan, blablabla...
* **00:13:04** He's taking a very active role in the day-to-day management of the team volunteers that we have  He surfaces the problems that needed my attention to me, so he's also done a really a excellent job. [In the long-term], there’s not some group of [people] that are the “end all be all” administrators.
* **00:13:36** I haven’t named those people yet [or] decided what to do about that. In the short term, nothing should change from a user's perspective., [Classifying them] isn't fair to the other team members, The three core team members, who are the three minimum set of  people I need to ensure a smooth transition, have all decided to pitch in .
* **00:13:57** Are there any other chans you visit? Actually, because people ask me this a lot: Obviously I visit other websites. I visited other imageboards over the years but I don't actively use any, because 4chan is a handful, [it] already has all of my interest represented on it. There's not really a compelling reason to use other web sites. 
* **00:14:23** I'm sure I’ll have an opportunity to do this later but, I actually did want to give a shout out to kirtainer (who runs 420chan) [who sent me an email that said] ‘hey, it's been forever’, a day or two ago. To single out 420chan, it’s actually one of the imageboards that I have actually respected over the years. I think that what's kind of defined a lot of image boards, even going back to the first kind of spin off from 4chan (which was 5Chan), 7chan and all these others. They tend to spin out based on a decision I make, or they don’t like me, or they don’t like 4chan, or they don’t like 4chan culture or whatever. More or less over the years, most of those sites have kind of fizzled out.
* **00:15:10** While 420Chan started similarly to 5chan, (the admin didn’t like me), I really respect that he wanted to have a bunch of topics that 4chan didn’t have but 420Chan  essentially [made] into being because it was like:
* **00:15:24** “Hey, 4chan is never  gonna have a drugs board, or a wrestling board, or all these other boards that I want, and so we may as well create a site that caters to that.” 
* **00:15:33** I really respect the fact that he really took it in its  own direction, it doesn't look like 4chan. The other sites [based on] Kusaba X (SP) created a whole era of open source clones of 4chan that offered 4chan in a box and emulated our front page and everything. People, for whatever reason wanted to make 4chan that wasn’t 4chan.
* **00:15:55** He really kind of made it his own. (I think he had another administrator at one point.) So i’ve actually been a huge fan [of 420chan].
* **00:16:03** Although I've never done a narcotic drug, I’ve never smoked weed or anything like that (I never really had a reason to use it), I don’t watch wrestling either (sorry
/sp/ or /asp/), I’ve always actually really respected that site. So, it’s good to see that there are people trying to do neat things out there. 
* **00:16:23** Why did I stop lifting? I stopped lifting probably about a year ago. But I actually stopped going to the gym last September. I think I have it in my phone, actually my last like update on my note was like in September 9th or 10th. 
* **00:16:40** That was a result of The Fappening, because of the emotional and kind of physical toll that that took on me. I mean September was a really rough month. I mean we started it with The Fappening, (you’d have to be under a rock to not know what that is)
* **00:16:58** One day, August 30th or 31st. or September 1st, I think we served about 93 million page views in one day. Over the month of September (which
doesn't include late August traffic) we served 45
million unique visitors and about 980 or so million page views, the closest we ever got to doing a billion page views. 
In a normal month 4chan will serve about 20 to 22 million unique visitors and about 500 million page views a month (now it's actually closer
to 610-615.)
* **00:17:28** Actually we probably did do a billion just given that so many people, like all of our friends on /g/ block Google Analytics (aka Google botnet). Analytics is not always the best [statistic]. So that month we probably did break a billion page views.
* **00:17:57** I was just completely overwhelmed. We got many a legal nastygram from obviously all the firms representing the actresses. We spent a shit load of time on the phone with lawyers, and it cost us tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills. I'm so glad that I’ve done such a good job saving over the years because that on a bad day could have easily bankrupted the site. 
* **00:18:25** What else did we have that month? That was when /pol/ was doing the ebola jam too. [And] I guess that was when Gamergate began to find its mainstream audience.
* **00:18:43** Anyway, September was this long, long, long month. I just was so
overwhelmed dealing with all that stuff that I stopped lifting then and I actually haven’t been back to the gym since.
* **00:18:54** Have you installed Gentoo? # 574. I actually did install Gentoo a long
time ago on a really old laptop. I believe it finished compiling but I never actually really used it for anything.
* **00:19:09** I’m just gonna start skimming through
these ‘cause there are probably already thousands of questions already. 
* **00:19:13** Is /s4s/ still your favorite board? /jp/ is actually my favorite board according to what I said at the 10th anniversary panel a year and a half ago. [sarcasm] 
* **00:19:26** But [anyway], I really like /s4s/ a lot. I mean, I like all the boards. I’ve actually been spending a lot of time on /o/. DBT is one of my favourite threads these days, even though they’re pretty silly.
* **00:19:37** Trying to think of what else.
* **00:19:41** Yeah, I actually browse /a/ a lot (despite that they all flip their shit when I post) but it’s still actually a fun board. I mean, I would say again, for all the people that complain about /a/’s quality and blah blah blah, and Naruto threads, /a/ is really actually
truly one of the best boards.

### 0:20 - 0:30

* **00:20:00** I’ll look at the stats really quickly but /a/ is huge. I mean, it has historically been the third largest board, but maybe it's the fourth largest now.
* **00:20:10** You know, /a/ is very large. And despite the fact that it receives a lot of
posts, its quality tends to be quite high.
* **00:20:21** So let's see. The first sticky is already dead and I'm only like two questions in. I
guess we will be here for eight hours today.
* **00:20:28** /a/ is used by 850 or so thousand users alone per month and
serves about 23.5 million page views. For everybody who uses /a/, you now know that you have almost a million buddies.
* **00:20:47** #589 When did you decide to quit? It feels like you made a decision a while ago, at least a year or two ago. There are a lot of questions in here. But, I mean, I’ve said that in interviews and I think I said that on the news post, but again the announcement that I made on Wednesday is a long time coming. I mean it really wasn’t so much a matter of ‘if’ but rather ‘when’.
* **00:21:10** It had been on my mind for a long time and it really kinda entered
my [mind] probably about eight or nine months before the 10th [anniversary of 4chan].
* **00:21:22** I actually had this in my news post but I took it out.
* **00:21:26** You know, one of the questions I've gotten over the years (besides, ‘fuck you’, which really isn’t a question) is “What happens to 4chan if you die?”
* **00:21:37** I used to joke that, “Oh well I guess. My mother is next of kin so it would go to
her, and you’d have Mama Moot baking you some cookies,” or whatnot. (I’m kidding my mom doesn’t bake)
* **00:21:49** All joking aside, the prospect for the site would be very grim. I am the, again, sole owner, sole manager, sole administrator. I own the company. I own all the hardware. I have every single password, 
* **00:22:05** It’s always really funny to see conspiracy theories that exist about moderators and leaks and whatnot. Or how people seem to think that there's this cabal of SJW moderators managing the site, but 4chan’s hierarchy is essentially
completely flat.
* **00:22:27** Volunteer Moderators (Janitors) are at the bottom, then the Moderators, General Managers, and then myself. The General Manager position didn't exist until about a year or so ago, as a result of kind of my succession planning.
* **00:22:42** But… that's it. Whenever I see there’s been some really funny fake chat logs over the years and it’s always hilarious because I don't actually talk in the IRC channels that often. I don't consult moderators or janitors. I don’t share my thinking. 
* **00:23:01** In that sense I've been a pretty bad people manager. It's not a committee, it's not consensus driven at all. It’s really just I make decisions and sometimes communicate to them. A lot of the time they’re pretty much completely in the dark. I barely use IRC these days.
* **00:23:17** So every time I see those chat logs I laugh because… Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the channels are silent a lot of the time.
* **00:23:26** Anyway, the organisation is basically flat with me on top. That’s really unhealthy [once I consider] what should happen to [4chan] if I were to become incapacitated, if I were to get hit by a bus and die, or get a new job, get married, have kids, get burnt out, whatever.
* **00:23:46** All of those things would take me away from the site, [and by] a certain point in time, probably would have ensured 4chan’s death.
* **00:23:59** I've kind of joked in these interviews that… it's the opposite of that saying, ‘the captain shall go down with his ship’.
* **00:24:09** But this was like ‘The ship goes down with the captain.’ The second I take a step off the ship, the ship would implode. [Clearly], no ship should be designed that way.
* **00:24:17** So that's what kind of got me thinking about, well, how do I… how do I change that. And actually as it turns out, I wrote a news post in February of last year that I never posted (I just discovered it a few days ago), when I was about to publish the Wednesday announcement. 
* **00:24:36** [It] alluded to this very directly. “Next year, what I'm focused on is finding out how to make 4chan outlast me.” I had realized that the site would basically die without me. Long term planning came to my mind after 4chan hit our 10th anniversary, just because I never expected… no, nobody expected 4chan to make it 10 years, much less continue chugging on.
* **00:25:02** When 4chan turned five or six, I would think only about the year ahead. I’d think ‘Okay, what do I want to do next year?’ Are we gonna make it to six or seven?’
* **00:25:16** Once you hit ten, your frame of reference completely changes. It’s so inconceivable, that you make it to ten you begin to think, ‘Well, maybe it's not inconceivable that we’ll make it to twenty.’
* **00:25:29** And… I can’t... it's hard to name any website that I use that are twenty years, even ten years old. It really is an unprecedented milestone. And even then… for as many people who claim ‘4chan is kill’, [our traffic statistics show that] 4chan still has as much traffic its ever done. Its actually held that amount of traffic for about four or five 
years.
* **00:25:54** It's hard for communities to maintain that standard ‘cause they, you know, [fall apart someday]. So 4chan has peaked, it’s been a 4 or 5 year peak, which i think is actually quite, quite impressive.
* **00:26:08** I’m rambling so I lost my train of thought. But anyway, you know it just became clear to me that if I wanted to make it another ten or twenty years, something needs to change, and that something was me. So I spent the better part of the past year or two just thinking about what needs to change. I wanted to ensure that 4chan makes enough money to support itself.
* **00:26:32** [Just for example, look at] the servers. We've had some issues these past few days, but we upgraded a bunch of the servers. Even though I made this decision so long ago and I was really imminently going to leave weeks ago I mean we spent thousands of dollars upgrading the servers. That’s why he had that down time, you know it wasn’t a DDOS a few weeks ago. People thought it was. We upgraded all the servers and they all have much faster processors now and more RAM.
* **00:26:52** When the site isn't kind of having the hiccups that we've had the past few days it’s blazing fast. I released it's a lot faster and more
stable than it's ever been. For those of you who have been browsing 4chan for
more than a few years, I mean you probably remember how slow and unstable the site would be and it would go down for hours or days at a time and it would just be like you were using a dial up modem, it was that slow.
* **00:27:13** So that's in a good place and again like the team is kind of in its best place now more than ever. I really truly actually feel that it's in the best place to survive without me and so that's why I decided to step down and kind of allow for that to happen, because again it had to happen at some point.
* **00:27:30** Have you ever wanted say something but you couldn’t because of
your position as admin? Um, no not particularly. I guess that’s a pretty simple answer. Let me skim through these now because I’m only like 5 in.
* **00:27:48** What makes a good poster? I guess that’s a pretty good question. We’ve had this thing in the rules, maybe it’s in the FAQ, for a really long time that just said we haven’t accepted donations, and it’s something that people often kind of forget, but you know we used to take donations early in the site’s history from 2003 to 2005, haven't taken a single penny in donation since 2005. I fucking hate donations. Again go to the historical news pages, the news post is titled ‘If only it grew on trees’ where I wrote about the 4chan passes, but I explain some of my logic for hating donations. And I think there’s actually one before that from 2012 that kind of touched on it.
* **00:28:26** Anyway so we've always said because you can’t contribute money, what you contribute is posting right, posting quality threads, uploading images, you know, helping people find the source of something, which I guess you shouldn’t do outside of /r/. I don’t know and I mean it’s just like anything that especially in recent months, it's the people that sit around and whine about how bad 4chan is. Again if you want to say how much I suck, great, so be it. I wish you would do that over email because it really just kind of shits up the board and for as many people that believe we delete all that, we really don’t.
* **00:29:04** The people who kind of complain about how much a board sucks, or a thread sucks, or a user sucks, I mean really aren’t contributing anything. I mean it really just kind of mucks things up far more than just shutting your mouth. The way you address that is [to] drown out the shit post with quality posts or submit feedback or if there's like a real problem that we can actually address as the administration, email it to me.
* **00:29:30** I think it’s like sage, you know, back in the day, the sage or sage bombing threads and spamming and dubs and all of that. The quote unquote user moderation really hasn't worked on 4chan for the better part of the past 10 years once we reached a certain scale. I really kind of dislike the fact that people think that, again, complaining and shitting things up further is somehow better than just either zipping it or again deleting or ignoring, reporting and whatnot.

### 0:30 - 0:40

* **00:30:00** … or again just drowning out the shit with good stuff.  There's really no objective way to kind of say somebody’s a good poster because I mean it’s obviously completely subjective but I think deep down we all kind of know what that is.
* **00:30:15** –laughs- Did you sell the site to Anita Sarkeesian? No. Maybe she can do another Kickstarter and she can raise the money. Knowing you guys, you’d all
probably talk enough about it to actually drive enough traffic to it to maybe actually successfully fund it. Maybe that should be your next effort.
* **00:30:36** Should I check my privilege? Yeah, always. Early and often. Uh let's see. Why does your website suck? That is very old meme, I respect your old memeing.
 * **00:30:48** How are you today? I am great if you can’t tell. I mean that’s another thing I kind of mentioned in a lot of these interviews yesterday, but last year when I shut down my startup which was this four year slog and was kind of an emotional rollercoaster, I was in a good place but it was a bummer. Just a lot of things got compressed into a short span of time in terms of making the decision to shut down the company and helping the employees transition and actually shutting down the operations at the office, all of that. So that kind of left this emotional burden that took a few weeks and months to decompress and work that off.
* **00:31:31** Whereas with 4chan, actually like yesterday or I guess Wednesday when I posted that [newspost] I was actually waiting for the emotions to sneak up on me. Maybe I sound apathetic. I mean it’s really not that. I think I’ve reached a point of zen of sorts. I mean I really truly don't have negative feelings. I mean just in general life. For people who are angry on the internet, I really really honestly truly hope that you one day find the beauty in just not caring about things or just not allowing strangers and things outside of your control to rile you up because it’s a very healthy way to live. I'm sure that you’ll add a few extra years to your life by keeping your heart rate down.
* **00:32:12** Again, I rarely feel negative feelings or angry at this point, and it’s the same for 4chan. I mean I look back and I think I’ve been feeling very nostalgic especially over the past few days just seeing some of the cards people have made me and some of the people linking to the old 4chan.org/flash, flash archive, and just posting old memes and old images and stuff like that and it really just takes me back. A lot of people who probably haven’t used the site for eleven years because I think very few of us have.
* **00:32:47** A decade is just such a hard amount of time to actually think about and it's just incredible. So I think as I can decompress and reflect over the coming weeks I’m sure more of those emotions will surface. But I mean right now I just feel extremely content and satisfied. Just really proud of the community and again the community is unprecedented. There are very few communities that are 4chan’s size. There are much fewer communities that have actually been around for as long as 4chan has and that's incredible. So I’m very glad that I had the privilege to be a part of that. So nothing but positive vibes right now.
* **00:33:31** What do you regret the most? This is actually a  great question. This is #608. A lot of things. Actually I kind of take that back. I mean on one hand I generally don't feel regretting anything is healthy because it’s kind of both eyes forward instead of one or both fixed on the past. You know you can’t change the past, you can only change the future and so it makes a lot more sense to take your energy and invest it in the future and changing those things. I really do believe that life is up and to the right. If you keep your head up and have a good way about you things get better. So I wouldn’t phrase it as regret so much as if I were to go back and change something or if I could possibly change a thing, which again I wouldn't because I think as long as you’re happy in the present and where you are then you have nothing to regret about that. I mean your past can be so shitty but as long as you’re happy today, then you really don't have anything to regret because the shit is what got you to the present. 
* **00:34:39** I’m so happy with where I am now and where the community is. So I don't think I would change anything, but if you know theoretically I were to go back and change something, I think I would’ve headed [or handed? Can’t tell] off this entire issue altogether with my succession by just doing a better job at managing the team from the start and really…there were a lot of people who I think wanted to help out early on and I didn't really give them that opportunity.
* **00:35:06** I really chose to shoulder most of the burden myself over the past eleven and a half years and, you know, I regret that in that I think that if I had kind of more people that I kinda trusted and again empowered early on and kind of treated as partners, it's interesting to you know kind of think about where we could be today or at least I’m sure a lot of the 4chan and life in general are these kind of peaks and valleys and I think having more support from you know a group of people that I really trusted and what not would have kind of smoothed out those peaks and valleys.
* **00:35:44** For a long time I used to describe myself as the loneliest webmaster and that’s because I really didn’t have many friends contrary to popular belief, all these wonderfully wild kind of theories that run about.
* **00:35:59** I am friendly with a lot of the moderators and janitors now as I’ve gotten to know them but they're not my friends, people that are my friends in real life have really never become involved with the site. I mean my friends outside of 4chan don’t use 4chan except for the people who I’ve met through the site.
* **00:36:16** I’ve made a lot of friends through 4chan over the years. At least a few dozen people I’ve met and a handful of very, very close friends I’ve met through 4chan. One or two of those people may be involved with the team, but I met them through 4chan and they were probably involved before I became friends with them.
* **00:36:32** But for a long time I felt very kind of isolated because again like 4chan as a community is kinda peerless and my kinda tenure as an administrator of a giant community for 10+ years is also peerless.
* **00:36:45** I mean it’s hard to name really any other analogous examples and so for a long time there wasn’t anybody, but once we reached a certain point like sure there are other website administrators that were running communities, but  once 4chan got into the millions, tens of millions of users I stopped having people I could ask for advice that at least had kind of first-hand knowledge or experience.
* **00:37:08** And so for a long time I think I kinda chose to go in alone and felt pretty lonely. So I think that had I done a better job at kind of managing the team volunteers then I could have drawn on them for support.  
* **00:37:22** But for whatever reason, I didn’t and again I would just say I was a terrible people manager early on. I was 15, like what does a 15 year old know about managing people? I mean I had my first job when I was 15 or 16 so.
* **00:37:32** I never managed anybody up until pretty recently, four years ago with the start up. I learned a lot about just how to direct people to make them feel appreciated and to know that you value their work and all of that.
* **00:37:52** This isn’t meant to be offensive, but I think a lot of 4channers are probably in their late teens, early twenties and so you may not have had this experience yet in your own careers, you know, leading people or managing people.
* **00:38:05** Just know that people deserve your respect and kindness.
* **00:38:11** Probably the worst thing I’ve done is that I would only really kinda reach out to people when they’ve done something wrong, which is like 1% of the time instead of the 99% of the time that they were doing a great job. It really breeds a pretty toxic work culture and relationship if you act that way.
* **00:38:26** As I’ve kind of grown up and had that first-hand experience I’ve really tried to be better to the moderators, but I have a lot to make up for there.
* **00:38:36** A lot of the users kind of treat them like shit, which, again, is a bummer because they’re all recruited. They’re all you. I mean they all come from the community. At this point the only way to become a moderator is to be a janitor. Only way to be a janitor is to be a 4channer and apply. They all really love the community and all have served it for hours and hours, days’ worth and weeks’ worth of their lives and rarely get thanks.
* **00:39:04** In lieu of receiving that praise from the community, which probably won’t change at this point, I wish I had done a better job at thanking them myself.
* **00:39:12** This is great. This is like very therapeutic. I’m glad we’re doing this. Let’s see.
* **00:39:22** #605. I think what many people are concerned about is who still owns 4chan in the future? I know you said the contrary in the VB interview, but even though you are stepping down as an admin can’t you still own the site just to make sure no one fucks it up to be some kind of plebbit 9fag facebook crap? We need 4chan to be 4chan.
* **00:39:44** As I said in that interview and other related interviews, I do want to completely step back. It’s time. It’s been eleven and a half years. It’s time for not only myself to move on, but the community to move on. I really view it as an opportunity for new leadership or the community to kind of go in a direction that I may not have taken it. For better or worse.

## 0:40 - 0:50

* **00:40:12** Maybe one day we’ll all realize how good we had it.
* **00:40:17** I really do want to yield fully and what I kind of thought about or kind of compared it to in the business world is like when a CEO steps down and remains with the company as the Executive Chairman of the board and you know it’s like that’s bullshit, right. You’re like ‘Oh I’m not CEO anymore, I’m not the President. I’m totally like hands off, guys.’ Right? But then you’re like, you’re chairman of the board. Like, you’re there. You can meddle. There’s baggage, especially when it’s the founder, somebody had this long tenure with the company. I mean there’s a lot of baggage that goes along with having that person continue to be involved in any capacity.
* **00:40:56** I really view my departure as a giant reset button, for better or for worse, for the transition team or whoever ends up being that long-term successor to make it their…you know.
* **00:41:10** Again, hopefully incorporate a lot of feedback from the community maybe in ways that I didn’t, to kind of go forward.
* **00:41:21** I don’t want to be financially or legally responsible for 4chan. I will at some point be transferring ownership and I honestly have no idea what that looks like because that’s kind of what I’m embarking on now is trying to figure out who that long-term successor is, successor or successors.
* **00:41:40** It would probably be my preference that it goes to some sort of organization of some kind. Maybe that’s a group of the volunteers or some other organization, because I realized in this whole succession planning thing that I really wouldn’t wish my past ten years upon anybody else. I’m very grateful for them and learned a lot and had these wonderful opportunities and experiences. I really do truly feel very warmly about the community and everything that’s happened these past ten years, but being a punching bag for millions and millions of people is not that fun for most people.
* **00:42:25** I think the only reason I was able to kind of deal with it over the years is because my general attitude toward life, which is very kind of happy-go-lucky and very, not blasé, zen is not the right word either, but…  I’ve always been really amused when people think I’m angry on 4chan because anger is just not something I often feel. If I do it’s actually usually, almost 100% of the time, I’m angry at myself.
* **00:42:51** I think the only reason I’ve been able to kind of have such an  even field relationship with the site or with my emotions in general is that I think about it similar to… here are three analogies that are kind of all over the place.
* **00:43:05** One is kind of like boiling a frog. If you throw a frog into boiling water it jumps out, but if you boil it over time then it croaks because it sneaks up on it. Or maybe a better example would be somebody who earns their wealth over time versus somebody who wins the lottery. The people who win the lottery tend to blow that money within a certain number of years. Where somebody who’s worked their lifetime and earned their wealth probably knows a little bit more about managing money, because they have the luxury of time, right. They’ve built that foundation. They have the tools to know how to do that.
* **00:43:42** I think that managing 4chan and dealing with the emotional burden of it was like that. I was 15. I’ve run 4chan all through my adulthood and this really formed my teen years and early adult years. So it kind of grew with me, I grew with it. It kind of snuck up on me.  
* **00:44:01** 4chan wasn’t an overnight success. It didn’t really peak overnight or something like that. It wasn’t like this overnight sensation. So I had this luxury of time to grow as a person and figure out how to manage my relationship with the community.
* **00:44:19** My big concern if I were to leave it to, say, a single individual is that it’s hard to find anybody really qualified in that sense. In fact I’ll tell you the one person in 11+ years, and I guess I never released this before, but I did actually try to give it to somebody about a year or two ago who I really felt was one of the only individuals I’ve met ever that I really truly felt was a good person. That’s not true, I’ve met a lot of good people, but you know, kind of had this assortment of really desirable traits. Just a really good person. Somebody who's used the community for a very long time, really understood it, has technical skills, has a real, I think, intuition about what people want and whatnot.
* **00:45:06** I essentially offered him the opportunity to basically just take it off my hands. I was like ‘if you want to be me, you can be me’ and he declined. Which all the more reinforces the fact that I think this was one of the few right people that I found over the years to yield that role, because people who want power don’t deserve it or can’t handle it. People who don’t want it are usually the best suited for it.
* **00:45:29** In this case I was basically turned down because I think he realized being moot is actually not so desirable and being able to pitch in part-time on the side and just use the site is a lot more fun than having thousands of angry detractors screaming at you. You know, screaming bloody murder for every change you make.
* **00:45:49** I hear the same thing from a lot of…we had a lot of janitors resign for the same thing. Not because they get driven out, but because your relationship with the site changes dramatically once you start volunteering for it. You go from being just a user to a certain kind of sense of responsibility or obligation. For the most part it makes it like not very fun.
* **00:46:13** I think normal users have the luxury of being able to enjoy the site without any sort of baggage. Whereas somebody who volunteers, or say, is the administrator of the site all of a sudden has all this baggage. If you truly enjoy using the site, then it really changes your relationship with the site and it kind of starts to make it look more like work than a leisure thing or a passion thing.
* **00:46:38** So that’s just a long winded way of saying I don’t really think there are people who are equipped to … I think it would be really challenging to find a single individual who is kind of equipped to take on all of the responsibility.
* **00:46:53** It’s not to say that I’m some shiny Pokemon and there’s only one of me, in the sense that there’s nobody who is qualified. Really it’s a lot to take on for any individual and I’m shocked that I was able to make it this far.
* **00:47:07** So I think there won’t be one administrator going forward. I think it’ll probably be an assortment of people, but it’s hard to know who exactly that person or persons will be right now. As soon as I know I’ll make an announcement.
* **00:47:29** #613. Who do we direct admin questions to? What things will we email? The kind of things that we would email you in the past? How do we get in touch with them? Use the feedback form. So we have this  feedback form, it’s linked from the front page. It’s at the bottom of the page. www.4chan.org/feedback. You can submit basically bug reports or complaints or feature suggestions. The transition people all have access to that.
* **00:48:05** I didn’t do a great job at updating it. We did actually, especially the programmer always checked in, so it’s actually great for bug reports because he checks it very frequently. I honestly didn’t check it as often as I might of liked to and didn’t really respond to many questions. I did, just as I read all of my email, I did read all of the feedback questions. That would be the best way to be in touch going forwards.
* **00:48:31** #614. Are you gonna add /l/ back before you leave? Nope.
* **00:48:34** Are you gonna post with a tripcode in the future? I don’t think so. I don’t see why I would. I can post anonymously, or we added an Admin Emeritus capcode that I guess I can use if I do want to be identified.
* **00:48:46** Are you planning on coming back as an admin? I’ve probably answered this three times already in a very long-winded fashion. I think you guys are just gonna have to learn to love or hate the new admin. Whatever capacity I’ll return as will be as anonymous, or again Admin Emeritus without the keys to the castle.
* **00:49:12** How do you think the culture of 4chan will change now that your influence from the top will be missing? #615. I don’t know. The team and 4chan has been a mootocracy from the start. Again, I didn’t do a great job at really accepting and asking for the input of the other team members. Every now and then I would run something by and just say ‘what do you guys think about this thing that I’m thinking about’. I really do look at my email and the community in general to help guide my decision making process, but at the end of the day those are just a handful of inputs. I’ve always had that 100% executive decision making ability. It will be really different.

## 0:50 - 1:00

* **00:50:00** One of the transition people asked me like ‘what do we do if this comes up or  what do we do if this?’ That’s something that really nobody has been prepared [for]. I mean I tried to prepare people as best I could, but nobody has ever been making really any single decision with 4chan except myself in almost eleven and a half years.
* **00:50:20** I’m sure things will change somewhat, but it’s hard to say how and I think it’s too soon to tell if it’ll be for better or for worse. We’ll just have to kind of play it by ear. I have invested interest in the site not sucking because I do use the site on a daily basis. Again going back to that first question, are you out of touch? Like my interests have changed over the years, but I really actually use 4chan every day. I am the longest running user of 4chan.  I’ve been using it since day one, since post one. I’d be really sad if I couldn’t browse /o/ and a few other [boards].
* **00:51:04** I actually do browse /a/, despite the fact that they yell at me all the time, and /s4s/ and whatnot. So I would be sad if I couldn’t browse those boards anymore if they changed dramatically, so I hope for the most part that nothing changes for the worse.
* **00:51:19** Are you currently working on any new projects? If so, can you elaborate? #63. There’s actually one idea that I’ve had. I’ve avoided startups like the plague for the past year since my PTSD from my last one. Now I’m out of that. I’ve had a year to decompress, but I don’t really have anything I’m working on right now. There’s one idea that I have, but it’s more of an open-source project. So to the extent that I actually work on it and/or release it then you can expect to see it as an open-source project probably most likely.
* **00:51:53** But no, I guess I have to figure out what the hell I’m going to do with myself going forwards now that 4chan won’t be one of my primary focuses. Again, 4chan has never been a full-time job for me. It’s just never been a job, I mean it’s never been my primary focus. I was either in high school, or I was in college, or I was working for other companies, I had my own company. 4chan has always been a labor of love and a hobby of mine.
* **00:52:57** One of the things I’ll miss the most about 4chan is just to have a project that has an infinite laundry list. We have a to-do tracking software and it’s just got hundreds and hundreds of tasks and I’m always adding little bugs [and] little features or stuff like that, or /qa/ing something, basically driving our developer nuts. It’s actually really incredible to have a project that you can invest time in, so I think that’s one of the things I’ll miss the most. Just having something to invest myself in.
* **00:53:08** #626 You say that 4chan is easily one of the greatest communities to ever grace the web, however it is widely accepted as one of the biggest shitholes on the internet, especially with gusto, by its own members. How do you reconcile creating and helping survive a place where boards such as /b/ and /pol/ serve as home bases for some of the world’s worst people to come praise and relish in one another’s vile bigotry and deviant socially destructive predilections with your relatively recently discovered identity as a social justice warrior?
* **00:53:38** I meant what I said. It’s a fact. It’s a statement of fact. I mean it is one of the largest and greatest and most storied communities to ever grace the web possibly ever. I mean it really is awesome. For as much as we’ve had our detractors over the years as a community, as a site I think 4chan has done far, far, far, far, far more good than bad. If you look at the stats, we’ve served a billion people according to google analytics over eight or so years. Those stats are from March 2008 or March 2009 onward to now.
* **00:54:31** Let’s just say google is full of shit and it’s not a billion, it’s 300 million or something like that. The fact is, hundreds of millions of people have used 4chan in some capacity, in some fashion, for minutes, hours, days, whatever. I would say there at least have been more than a hundred million dedicated users over the past ten years and for those people 4chan is really important to them. For a lot of people it functions as their third place; It’s not home, it’s not work, it’s not school. It’s a place where they go to blow off steam.
* **00:55:12**  One of the things that’s actually really kept me going over the years, that helped me survive burn out, was the fact that for as many nasty emails as I’ll get for the multitude of reasons over the past ten years, every single interaction I’ve ever had with some community person has always been very positive. For the most part they just say ‘hey, thanks for 4chan because it really helped me at this time in my life where I kind of needed help. I was in high school and going through a rough patch’, or ‘I was going through a break up’, or ‘I was miserable at work’, or ‘I was procrastinating for finals’, or something like that.
* **00:55:50** Essentially every single person I’ve met in person who’s come up to me on the street, which happens probably a few times a month, has said that. So I think knowing that the experience that the vast majority of people have with 4chan is a very positive one. For the most part, the fact that 4chan has kind of helped 100+ million people get through their day, I think the greater good has been served.
* **00:56:17** 4chan obviously has this negative reputation as this question alluded to and some of it is deserved, but I think actually a lot of it is not. I mean obviously /b/ and now I guess /pol/ kind of are the lightning rods of sorts. They kind of represent the most extreme portions of the site and that’s where a lot of people draw on and base their conclusions off of, but they represent just a fraction of the site and the community and the contents and posts. I mean when you look at boards like /a/ and /po/, which like nobody uses, but it’s like most people use 4chan to discuss their hobbies, right, their shared interests with a bunch of strangers who they have at least one thing in common with. That’s kind of boring, right. That’s not this sexy story and that’s not what the media will cover. That’s not what, as you said, the social justice warriors and people who are 4chan’s detractors, that’s not the story that they’ll tell because it’s nowhere near as interesting as talking about how /b/ is a boogeyman of the moment.
* **00:57:26** I think the boring truth is that 4chan is pretty tame and actually very positive community for most people. One other thing that’s interesting to note about why 4chan has that bad reputation is that 4chan is very unique in that it’s one of the only kind of platforms, I guess you could say, on the web that enables any person, regardless of their following or whatever, to get a message in front of 1000s of people, right. If you want to post ‘moot is a cuck’ to one of the boards, say /b/, you can do that. You can inform thousands of people of my fetishes and whatnot. We basically don’t prescreen comments except for banned mp5s and spam keywords and stuff like that, so almost any person on the entire internet can reach an audience of thousands to tens of thousands of people with a mash of their keyboard and a click of their mouse. That’s incredible. There really aren’t any other platforms on the internet that enable that to that degree.
* **00:58:40** I mean you have communities obviously like Reddit, you know our favourite, that sure you can get something in front of a lot of people on Reddit if you get on the front page, but what percentage of content makes it there? And it requires upvoting and karma, and all this hierarchy bullshit and whatnot, whereas 4chan is completely egalitarian in that sense. Other platforms like, say, Twitter. If you want to get a message in front of people on Twitter you have to have a lot of followers. How do you get a lot of followers? You have to have influence. If you upload a video on YouTube, five people will see it unless you have some way of getting on the front page and that usually requires you to have a following.
* **00:59:17** 4chan is really the only website I would say on the entire internet that forwards you an opportunity to get a  message in front of just a gazillion people without anything, without building that following. That was the beauty of anonymous posting. I mean that’s what I’ve given talks about. Contrary to everybody screaming about free-speech, my point in all of my talks, and verbatim basically quoting myself, Is that anonymous speech enables people to be equal and to say things that they might not otherwise be comfortable sharing on a  platform with identity. So that coupled with an ability to reach

## 2 Hours

### 2:00 - 2:10

* **02:00:00** Maybe I've shared this example in public before, (but I can't remember if I did last time). I've thought about it as if, there’s an office building and every floor has a water cooler. [The co-workers on a floor will form a unique culture of] banter. [For example,] /sp/ is the king of banter, where people want to post “power rankings” and all these other [threads, such as] “What cheeto is the best cheeto to eat watching the superbowl?” [That’s just what they want to do.]
* **02:00:23** And we say, "Oh, that's off topic," or "Can you do that on the cooking board?” There's a more appropriate board for discussing food preferences.
* **02:00:32** But people obviously don't want to do that. For the most part, [they] want to hang out in their [own] office floor, since that's where their buddies are. We're [telling them], "Hey, can you go use either the communal water cooler downstairs in the lobby and mingle with all these other strangers from our building,” or “Can you go upstairs to this other office where your conversation may be more appropriate."
* **02:01:00** And people [tell us], "Well no, I want to use the water cooler on my floor, what the fuck? These are where my coworkers are. These are where my friends are. Why would I want to [go elsewhere]? You know, I can't be arsed to go downstairs and fuck around with strangers. [Damn] those crossboarders,” and whatnot.
* **02:01:14** So we [met] a lot of challenges over the years moving topics, disallowing topics, or moving them to where they'd be more appropriate, because people just simply do not want to move and don't want to be exposed to people that they don't think are “cut from the same cloth” or don't “represent them”. 
This is unfortunate. 4chan is a large community and we have a bunch of different boards that cater to different interests. We used to encourage people to use the other boards. “There are more boards out there that are more appropriate for some topics you're trying to squeeze into your homeboard.” But alas, as it turns out, people don't agree with that. So we've taken more of a hands-off approach.  
* **02:02:07** For a long time I was basically working on features. I mean, we thought about a categories system. I spent months and months and months thinking about this.
* **02:02:15** You know, a different thread type or some sort of category thing or 'nesting boards' or 'linking boards' somehow and really trying to kind of… Again, the big challenge that 4chan has had is how do you cram as many people into as small a space as possible where people have very different ideas or opinion about what should and shouldn't be discussed. And, again, how do you accommodate as many of those people as possible and please as many of those people as possible realizing that you can't please everybody, but again, how do we do our best at that? And I spent a long time trying to think of solutions for that, that wouldn't really fundamentally alter the experience of 4chan for most people, but ultimately came up without any sort of silver bullet because there really isn't a silver bullet. It really is just, it's so based on one's preference, and the minority tends to be the most vocal and so we ended up just leaving with the status quo because it was hard to come up with a solution that would solve that problem for most people.
* **02:03:24** And just for example, 250,000 people browse /sp/ every month, at least in the last 30 days. And actually it's very… sunday is like a friggin shit-show I guess. You know, people like their sports on sundays.
* **02:03:53** Number 847. If you could've ran any website that wasn't 4chan or Canvas or Drawquest as successfully as you have for these past years, what type of website would it have been or was an imageboard always your first choice?
* **02:04:03** That assumes that I have run 4chan successfully, which for all the detractors, I challenge you to find an example of one individual managing a website for ten plus years, much less a community. But, um, I digress. You know, I mean, 4chan was a happy accident. People remind me of this all the time and try to rub it in my face, discounting how… You know, the one thing I think has kind of amused me over the years is how people for no reason discount how much work has gone into making 4chan what it is today. Not to discredit the community. The community has made 4chan what it is today, but conveniently forgets the fact that we have put in hundreds to thousands of hours of coding and provisioning servers and setting them up, fixing them and coding them, making features and making the code better. 4chan didn't even have image repl… I mean futaba's original code didn't even have image replies when I first started working on it.
* **02:05:10** First of all, if you look back at futaba and 2chan.net, it is jank as fuck. 4chan with the inline extension and even just a lot of the conventions. The board directories and stuff like that. People who haven't used this site from day one, I think, don't appreciate how 4chan of today represents the collective efforts of tens of millions of users, hundreds of millions of users over the years, but also, again, hundreds of volunteers who've really dedicated a lot of time. Not just me, I mean, more so others than me at this point because there's more of them and they've collectively… and I've put in easily over ten-thousand hours over the past decade, but, you know, they've put in tens of thousands of hours as a group and 4chan does represent the collective efforts of lots of people and its just changed so much and I think is the best imageboard there is in terms of both community and its functionality and all that stuff. 
* **02:06:05** But again, going back, It was a happy accident and so I had no… again, I grew with it over the years. It grew. Everything was gravy to a certain degree but I never expected to, I mean I never intended to run a large website. I mean, it really was just something for a few of my friends and it just kind of grew from there and, you know, I grew with it. Tried to keep it growing as best I could in terms of just scaling the site and the architecture and all of that to account for its increasing usage and for the most part I think that the fact that we're here today is a testament to the fact that, you know, we did it. We all succeeded and despite controversies, despite legal hassles, despite financial… you know, it was dire years ago when I was basically personally bankrupt and in debt, to now where it's not a great business but I still found a way to make it work.
* **02:07:05** You know, the team, I mean 4chan kind of stands today in spite of itself. Between internal and external forces it's really been quite the uphill battle and I'm very proud that we made it here, this far. And, again, the entire point of the past two years has been to ensure that 4chan can survive another ten years. So I think that I would be very happy to look back 9 more years from now at 4chan at 20 and just go " Wow, that's incredible." Again, how many communities have done that? 
* **02:07:35** So you get a lot of shit from people when the leak happened (The Fappening) and yes, a ton, and that's why I stopped lifting and spent a jillion dollars on lawyers and blah blah blah, so I already answered that.
* **02:07:48** Number 856. What was your biggest administrative error that you ever made in your time here? I would say it would be, and I've said this in talks, and I've said this in interviews and people point it out and kind of call me out on it but I think communication has been challenging over the years. It's just so hard to communicate with as many users as 4chan has, especially given these days. 
* **02:08:11** In the early days, 4chan users were all sort of cut from the same cloth. I mean they're all from Something Awful or raspberryheaven or this IRC channel. They're all anime nerds basically. And today the 4chan userbase is very diverse and the slate of boards we have are very diverse, so 4channers tend to be very opinionated and also for some reason believe that their opinions are weightier than others and are deserved to sometimes be heard over others. 
* **02:08:48** It's made it really challenging over the years to continue to manage, to kind of keep the ship sailing and keep things kind of copesetic [Editor’s note: copesetic means satisfactory] and running smoothly because as the site's grown, its become so diverse and so varied. So it's a challenge to, as it grows, as the absolute number of people gets larger, gets very hard to manage but also again as the demographic broadens, it's even harder to manage. 
* **02:09:19** And so I think allowing myself to kind of fade [away] in terms of communication obviously wasn't a good thing. You know, I've been active for the entire time, I've just opted to be a lot more “behind the scenes”, show my face less, do less of these kind of Q&As, and post less, because after a certain point it wasn't really fruitful. 
* **02:09:40** I mean it would just derail the thread and I'd just have people yelling all sorts of bizarre conspiracies at me, trying to get a rise out of me, trying to get me to ban them, or trying to hurt my feelings. That made it a [poor] use of my time or anybody's time [for me to communicate]. 
* **02:10:24** [Unfortunately], as we've all learned, in the absence of [an explanation], people fill that vacuum with the most hilarious, bizarre shit. 99.99% of the time, it's completely wrong. When other people parrot [that shit], it becomes accepted as a fact. And then people will immediately ignore what I say if it's not exactly what they were looking to hear. I think my lack of communication has allowed that to happen. 
* **02:10:40** But, again, that lack of communication came as a result of this dynamic that exists in the community. and so it's kind of this weird trichromatic [Editor’s note: means to possess three independent channels for conveying information, usually color] problem so I really was less visible after starting my startup until

* **04:00:00** Again, I read this and I get a lot of projection.
* **04:00:03** I mean, it's true - 4chan was, in a lot of ways, a freak accident, as most successes are.
* **04:00:12** Again I think that people who say this and kind of try to discredit the accomplishments of the site are kind of doing a disservice to the community, and also, the dozens to hundreds of volunteers who have pitched in over the years, myself included.
* **04:00:28** For whatever reason, their genesis story of 4chan tends to be "it just got shat out overnight in its existing form and was just magically popular and has all the features and all that" and don't appreciate, again, that obviously it took people and took community, but it also took, for me personally, over ten thousand hours and, I mean, probably like a hundred thousand plus hours of volunteering and really hard work to get to where it is today.
* **04:00:54** And that's the case for any business, so, I mean, sure, let's call it a happy accident, but I think you're kind of deluding yourself, kind of misguiding yourself to believe that a lot of people, especially the community, including volunteers, didn't work very hard to get the site to where it is today and maintain it where it is today. 04:01:24
* **04:01:41** "What if they make Asuka a lesbian? - 1796". I would be so sad - Asuka is my 2D waifu.
* **04:01:46** Asuka is best girl.
* **04:01:49** I guess Usaka is best girl.
* **04:02:23** Hold on one second guys, I need to...
* **04:02:29** [Transformers sound effect]
* **04:02:42** Heh.
* **04:02:46** "4chan won't stop straight after this stream, will it? - 1843". Uh, I don't think so. I don't see why  it would. I guess I haven't been posting so I don't know how the servers are running right now. But hopefully everything's fine.
* **04:03:00** 1844 said "Is 4chan still growing? I remember during the 2010 4chan panel--" You're mistaken, you're probably referring to the 2013 one. "-- you showed a ridiculous growth during the whole decade it was alive - will it ever end? Do you think it'll get even faster while you're gone?"
* **04:03:13** You know, 4chan is growing very slightly. I mean, it's grown mostly in terms of its pageviews.
* **04:03:26** My lips are chapped. Ow. I'm just gonna be drinking, Mark.
* **04:03:30** So it's not growing -- I mean, it's actually incredible that it's gotten to where it is today and it's actually maintained a similar level of traffic -- actually, it's grown...
* **04:03:45** We changed the tracking tag a little bit - where we displayed it -  so we don't display it on 404 pages anymore, so we saw kind of a dip in traffic and kind of a rebalancing of traffic - kind of this new floor as a result of where we put the Google Analytics tag.
* **04:03:59** Again, more or less, the site has not really declined nor grown dramatically over the years, but really just maintained a respectable amount of traffic, so who knows?
* **04:04:17** And also, I don't know which graph you're referring to - I think it might've just been the year-to-date - sorry, the history-to-date graph of the traffic, but 4chan, I think, spiked in about 2010 - it kind of accelerated, then kind of slowed down and levelled out, but 4chan has never really had a hockey stick or any sort of...
* **04:04:42** Really, the one time that stands out - sorry, now two times - the one time that stands out as sort of a big drive of traffic was when we were featured on the front page of Wikipedia.
* **04:04:52** No other press really sent a meaningful amount of traffic, no other event really sent a meaningful amount of traffic before last September, outside of the Wikipedia "Featured Page of the Day".
* **04:05:06** And then, last September obviously. I mean, it was a gigantic surge in traffic as a result of The Fappening. Funny thing is, we have lost money on that because our hosting costs went up and, you know, we barely make money and people didn't really purchase more ads and so we didn't benefit from all that traffic.
* **04:05:24** Some of that traffic, I think, stuck on a little bit, but again we've never seen ridiculous growth.
* **04:05:29** It really has been kind of "The Tortoise and the Hare" and we've definitely been the tortoise.
* **04:05:35** Which I think in the case of the community is actually very healthy.
* **04:05:37** I think it's... if we had seen sudden growth like that, kind of a spike...
* **04:05:46** That would be... it's very hard for a community to adjust to a sudden influx in traffic.
* **04:05:53** Both kind of architecturally, in terms of scaling, and socially, like the social dynamics and the culture to kind of keep up with rapid growth like that and more often than not I think you see a lot of problems being attributed to this.
* **04:06:04** And so the fact that 4chan has grown slowly over time is a good thing, so hopefully it will continue to grow, but kind of slowly.
* **04:06:31** "Hey moot, you mentioned last panel that we were working on a solution to the /v/ problem - too much (sic) boards for one topic - what was your solution and will we ever see it? - 1863"
* **04:06:39** I kind of alluded to that earlier... we're thinking about, you know, categories, or sub-boards or tags or [???] and we'd played with so many different kinds of thread types and we'd played with so many ideas there and fleshed them out and I would go to our developer and say "can we do this?" and we'd poke holes in it.
* **04:07:03** So we never really got there. I mean, I played around with a lot of things and got to a point where I was just like "it's not worth shaking the uh... rocking the boat here".
* **04:07:22** And sure, the current system isn't ideal, but I think that making a major change to the way the site is structured is probably going to do more harm than good at this point.
* **04:07:34** And so I don't have any plans outside of the brainstorming over the past year or two, but that's not to say that it's not going to change in the future going forward - it's out of my hands at that point...
* **04:07:51** So I don't know, unfortunately the stuff that I alluded to a year and a half ago at that panel are kind of no longer in the works.
* **04:08:03** "Why is Bella Thorne so perfect?" That's an Asuka... cosplayer. 1883.
* **04:08:09** She is pretty perfect. Based Asuka and 3DPD. Maybe we can set us up on a McDonald's date.
* **04:08:32** "Are you a virgin?" [???]
* **04:08:35** I am not a wizard, I'm very sorry. I've never posted on Wizardchan, I don't think they would accept me.
* **04:08:59** Alright, so 48000 people listening. Geez. And I'm still at the point in the thread before this even begun (sic). I guess I haven't seen all the wonderful replies screaming about my responses. Now, let's see...
* **04:09:20** "Are you gonna take a retirement vacation? 2034". Honestly, I haven't planned anything yet. I really should go to Mootxico. I was going to make that joke in that post. Hopefully if I do I'll get a good picture and I'll upload it somewhere so you all can see it and I'll be sipping a Corona - which is a terrible beer.
* **04:09:38** Sipping hopefully a craft beer of some kind on the beach in glorious Mootxico, but I don't have any vacation plan. In fact, I joked to a reporter on Wednesday that I spend most of the morning after I post my posts lounging around unshowered in my pajamas on my couch, and I...
* **04:09:58** I don't know if I've showered at that point. I guess I've showered at that point. I donned pants and I went outside and I ate a dollar slice - ate a $4 lunch at - I guess it was a $2 slice and a can of seltzer - I guess $2.50, damn, pizza's getting expensive.
* **04:10:15** Yeah, two hundred... two dollar fifty slice of pizza, one dollar fifty can of seltzer. Times are a'changing. So that was my retirement lunch. And I actually, also, had a slice of pizza today.
* **04:10:25** Although it was a fancier slice of pizza - it was three fifty. Because it wasn't just a plain slice, so no, I have not spent lavishly on my retirement, nor do I expect to.
* **04:10:37** I did have a really good ice cream sundae, though, on Wednesday night, and I'm still paying the price for it because I still feel sick from eating it. That was my retirement, I guess. Celebratory meal.

### 6:00 - 6:10

* **06:00:00** If you remember 10 years ago, servers and hosting were a lot more expensive than they are now, uh, even though 4chan was much smaller everything was a lot more expensive. 
* **06:00:10**  I mean - back then it was about 10 dollar a Mbit and that was a good deal at the time, um now you can get away wit like 2-3 dollars a Mbit depending on who you’re hosting with.
* **06:00:20** Uh so we took donations and we raised 14 thousand dollars and I delivered the goods, y’know I bought servers and within a few months I colocated them and it’s been 10 years since I’ve asked for another cent and so I delivered that one year and then gave you an extra 9 on the house. 
* **06:00:35** So I am very proud that we were able to do that, and the reason I was okay with doing that and the reason I am not okay with doing donations now (because I don’t really believe in them in general), is that, y’know, that was very explicit because there was clear expectation as far as what was expected. Here’s the ask, here is what I want to do and what I need and  have done the math, and yeah I think I can make good on this, very much like a Kickstarter model this is the project I want to do.
* **06:01:05** And we did it, and I fulfilled and I satisfied my backers, I fulfilled that problem and again, I gave 9 years on the house. And I think that again there was a very explicit and social contract that existed between myself and the users who donated and I fulfilled my side of that bargain and whereas I feel that with ongoing donations the challenge that you have is that there’s kind of more this implicit expectation how that money will be used and what should be expected in return for the donation.
* **06:01:36** It’s very hard to find consensus amongst the administration y’know, me in this case and the users and how that money should be spent and what they should expect in response. You end up seeing this really unhealthy, uh, disconnect or dynamic where uh, even when we took donations years and years ago I got emails for years from people saying “I donated so you should unban me” or “I donated so you’re a fucker for doing this” or “I donated and you should make me a mod” 
* **06:02:02** It’s like people would kind of have these kind of demands or these really out of whack expectations in terms of what they should receive and in response for the donation and it was kind of like a future favour that they had bought and if they got unhappy over time they would regret the donation and so I really do believe the Kickstarter model works a lot better because I really think you need to be really explicit about what the money will go to or how to satisfy.
* **06:02:31** You need some way of meeting those expectations and satisfying a kind of contract that exists and when it’s this kind of implicit amorphous thing, over time it uh, it just doesn’t work and again I think uh, at 4chans scale now it just doesn’t work for sites past a certain scale so it worked for us for a time, and it really doesn’t work going forwards and I really just don’t like that social dynamic that exists so I decided that we were going to sell the 4chan passes.
* **06:03:05** And some people kind of treat them as a donation, they want to support the site, um, but this is a product that we’re offering, it’s a service that we offer, same thing with advertising. We offer good and a service in exchange and as long as we give you your 4chan pass you got what you paid for, as long as we give you your 20 dollars worth of advertising, you hundred thousand impressions or whatever, you got what you paid for.
* **06:03:28** And so, uhm, it’s a lot easier to satisfy those expectations when it’s a  good service being offered instead of this  “Noo you’re gonna donate” and 5 years from now you’re going to tell me I’m bullshit and you want your money back or tell me you should be a moderation. And you know it’s funny, that’s kind of died out now but for years I would get this, and after a certain point it was easy to call bullshit on people because they would say “oh I’ve donated last year” or “I’ve donated 2 years ago” and I’d just be like “we haven’t taken donations for 8 years so fuck you, you’re full of shit” y’know, like there’s no way, I mean I never said that I just never responded.
* **06:03:59** But uhm, y’know people would try to uh, y’know, kind of hold that over me so, let’s see…  Uhh let’s see…  37 thousand viewers, I’m boring some of you to tears, thank god. Uhh “Do you appreciate repeating digits?”, Yes I do I am reformed, I love dubs now, in fact you should be sure to thank people and appreciate their dubs when they… Oh my god this is wow, somebody said “Did you see the Habbo Hotel raid we did last night when you announced your retirement, Pooles closed 2015”, Uh I had not seen that, that is uh, that’s funny, that really takes me back, thank you that’s very sweet of you.  
* **06:06:00** I’m trying to figure out, how long have I been streaming right now? It’s gonna kick me off at some point, I guess I’ve been on here for hours but when is it going to kick me off… let’s see. “I think it’s good you decided to move on from 4chan, I think you should start movements, build them up then let them go like Notch when he sold Minecraft, don’t put yourself in a box, don’t limit yourself from what you could be, my question is what projects are you thinking about pursuing post 4chan, will you keep on advocating for anonymity?”
* **06:06:54** Yeah again, I consider myself an advocate, not an activist, um, yeah again I really believe in anonymity, uh, I’m still waiting for somebody to quote me on the free speech stuff I think again, as I pointed out in that sticky have kind of chosen to conflate or willingly misinterpret being an advocate for anonymity as being an advocate for free speech, um, and highlighting how anonymity enables you to share things that you might not otherwise be comfortable sharing and that it enables raw unfiltered speech, and kind of again conflating that with a different concept.
* **06:07:30** But y’know I have always considered myself an advocate for anonymity and… or really y’know people try to paint this in black and white, but if you look at my um, I did a talk Web 2.0 summit 2011 and I talked about identity and this concept of prismatic identity, and my point was that people often paint the world in this kind of duality, and uhm, and so they paint it in terms of anonymity and facebook identity, real identity, first and last name identity, and I think that really oversimplifies, and  identity is a spectrum.
* **06:08:20** There’s a lot of options, you can be anonymous, you can be anonymous on the front end like you are on 4chan, you can be anonymous on the back end say like using TOR or TORchat or something like that, you can use a pseudonym that changes from place to place, you can have one that’s fixed, you can have first name, first name last name, first name profile picture.  
* **06:08:42** So, there are all of these different options that exist and what I’ve tried to do is kind of highlight that, yes there’s options, we should continue to use those options and not limit ourselves to just the one, the type of identity that in vogue right now which is, y’know, for a long time it has been Facebook identity and  I think we’re seeing things kind of pull away from that a bit, so again, anonymity or anonymous contribution as an alternative to that and uh, is a valid and also desirable alternative and people should build products that incorporate the flexibility and identity rather than this one concept of it.
* **06:09:20** So that’s what I’ve tried to be an advocate for over the years, just having options and highlighting what some of those options are, and my feelings there haven’t changed. But you know if you look at it I haven’t really given any talks for the last year or two, I really stopped doing press for 4chan a while ago, because I’ve already said all this, I’ve already put it out there and think that it’s.. There’s nothing new that I really have to contribute on this subject, at least not now. I mean last year people reached out for comment on all of these anonymous apps but  I don’t really use them or really care about them so I didn’t have a lot to say.

* **07:50:22** Let's see...                   
* **07:51:23** I'll look for a good final question.
* **07:51:42** That's a kinda... and, uh, this one, 5618. Hey Moot; considering how much the internet has changed in the past few years, how long do you think the internet or at least the mainstream internet will last or is 4chan a relic of a past era?
* **07:51:57** Uh... In my Ted Talk in 2010, so what is that, that's about exactly five years ago, it was February 2010, I refer to 4chan as kind of a dinosaur, and so, uh, a relic of that past era, and I think it's more or less continued to be the case, and I can't think of that many kinda high profile, uh, you know, websites that have kind of popped up in the anonymity space, with the exception of, you know, we saw some of these anonymous apps like Whisper, Secret and Yik Yak and stuff like that on mobile devices. So I think that, um...
* **07:52:40** I think people see an opportunity on mobile devices right now to kind of play around with identity. Uh, but I think on the internet, on the web, we haven't seen that much in the way of interesting, uh, apps that kinda begin to play with identity and kinda appreciate a, uh, um, kind of a spectrum that goes beyond, um, uh, you know, just this one form of identity. So, uh, I think 4chan is a relic of the past. I think, I wouldn't discount, or, uh, you know, say that we won't see more kind of interesting attempts in those spaces but I think they're going to end up being a mobile. So maybe I'll work on one of those apps at some point although mobile's not super interesting to me, but in the one idea I had for a kind of open source project is kind of involving anonymity and community and stuff so, um.
* **07:53:30** - Anyway, so, uh, this is where I say goodbye. Truly, finally say goodbye. I've got a few minutes before I cut out here. Uh, if you've made it through all 8 hours of this, then, congratulations. Um, but, uh, yeah, thanks for listening to me drone on. I hope this was as kind of therapeutic and cathartic for you as it was for me. It was nice to kinda, uh, you know, answer a few questions and kinda say goodbye in an, uh, 8-hour-streaming fashion, but, um, again, I hope and I really wish the community the best, and I hope that, uh, in my 11 and a half years I was able to do more right than wrong. I certainly feel 4chan has done far more right than wrong again, but, I hope that in my kind of 10 years as the, you know, founder, the kind of first administrator, that I was able to please, uh, you know, the majority of you, and I think in fact I did; again, it tends to be a very vocal minority that, uh, tends to say otherwise, but, uh, you know, I really do see a bright future for 4chan, and, um, you know, really, again, I don't know how things can change long term, again, I've tried to do my best to ensure kind of a smooth transition, and I will do my best to find a long term successor that is kind of, you know, keeping with the spirit of the community, you know, has the community's interests in hand. But, uh, it's hard to predict the future, but again I really see this as an opportunity for both the community and my eventual successor to kind of reset, and to kind of be unburdened by myself and my relationship with the site and my history, um, and so that means things might change a little bit, but, uh, again, I think, uh, for the most part I expect things to change for the better. Uh, I mean, I do see a lot of opportunities for the site to grow and continue to be a really important piece of the web and be an important part of the lives of the people who use it. So, um, yeah, it was really truly a great honour and, uh, a great privilege.
* **07:55:30** So... hahaha, I'm just reading some of the chat right now (transcriber – that was the only intelligible thing I could make from it. He said it really fast). Um, trying to figure out what I'm going to say, but um, yeah. Thanks for allowing me to be a part of this, and I really appreciate you all being apart of it; again, don't be strangers, you know, follow me on my blog, chrishateswriting.com, you know, my Twitter account, @moot, or send me an email, send me a goodbye, moot@4chan.org. Uh, you know, even the not-so-kind words are appreciated. Um, but, uh, yeah. I, you know, I really wish you all the best, I hope that something positive came from this livestream, or, uh, you guys take away something from it, or I answered a question that you had, or you got a better sense of the kind of person I am. So, um, keep on trucking, and, uh, again, enjoy life, take it easy. Enjoy 4chan, I think it's going to be around for a really long time. So, uh, thanks for, uh, thanks for making it really special and thanks for making the past 11 and a half years of my life, uh, you know, really special, so. Hah, I'm so tempted to say “Ayy lmao” as my last words. Uh, but I'll just say, “See you later, Space Cowboy”.
