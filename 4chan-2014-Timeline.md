Unfortunately, we haven't been very adept at keeping up the timeline. But starting from December 2014, we'll try to keep up.

## December 2014

### Events

*Major events or incidents involving 4chan anons.*

* 2014 4chan Autumn Babby Cup
* 2014 4chan Winter Cup

### Structural Changes

*Changes (permanent or temporary) to the structure of 4chan's website.*

* **2014-12-04** /a/ - Usaka Day. A terrible sketch of Asuka from Evangelion is made /a/'s header image, along with a ear grating bicycle horn rendition of Cruel Angel's Thesis. All other boards get a BKUB Chen header image and the bike horn.

* **2014-12-07** /pol/ and /s4s/ - Moot starts the day by testing out **CAPTCHA-less posting on /pol/.** As a result, eager anons begin to flood the board, and /pol/ users evacuate to colonize /s4s/. By the end of the day, moot renames /pol/ to [The 8 steps of Cuckolding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk), and autoplays this linked youtube video in the background.
