**Three Angled Blue** is 4chan's most influential artist. 

Once, there was a time when rage comics were good. They were detailed prints that distilled powerful action scenes and striking faces twisted in anger, reminiscent of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

They contained parables that warned anons of the dangers of ironic shitposting, or satirized the inane discussions by trolls who troll the trolls.

The rage faces of today are a pale mockery of his legacy. 

Today, very few people, even anons struggle to recall his name. But all will recognize his creations from a mile away. 

And thus, we built this art collection, with the purpose of highlighting the artists behind the art, such that their works shall not perish from the earth.

## Collection / Gallery

Most of Three-Angled-Blue's works were posted anonymously on 4chan, and need to be listed in a showcase.

### Comic Dub Adaptations

Some anons have created some amazing voiceovers for his comics, 

## EPIC FRUSTRATION

EPIC FRUSTRATION is the Bayeux Tapestry of 2006's /b/day, where floods of anons from /b/ revolted against new rules imposed by the moderation team, and raided other 4chan boards, such as /trv/, and most of all, /v/.

/v/ fought back.

## Project Hate Machine

Three Angled Blue is now MIA, long gone now and probably never to return. But there are those who evoke his legacy.
