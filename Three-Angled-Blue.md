**Three Angled Blue** is 4chan's most influential, most beloved artist. 

Despite what you may believe, once upon a time, there was an age when rage comics were good. They were detailed prints that distilled powerful action scenes and striking faces twisted in anger, reminiscent of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

They contained parables that warned anons of the dangers of ironic shitposting, or satirized the inane discussions by trolls who troll the trolls.

The rage faces of today are a pale mockery of his legacy. 

Today, very few people, even anons struggle to recall his name. But all will recognize his creations from a mile away. 

And thus, we built this art collection, with the purpose of highlighting the artists behind the art, such that their works shall not perish from the earth.

## Collection / Gallery

Most of Three-Angled-Blue's works were posted anonymously on 4chan during 2008, and are starting to get lost in history as link rot sets in. The loss of the Chanarchive is a bitter blow against the record of his work.

### Comic Dub Adaptations

Some anons have created some amazing voiceovers for his comics.

## EPIC FRUSTRATION

EPIC FRUSTRATION is the Bayeux Tapestry of 2006's /b/day, where floods of anons from /b/ revolted against new rules imposed by the moderation team, and raided other 4chan boards, such as /trv/, and most of all, /v/.

/v/ fought back.

## Influence

Three Angled Blue is now MIA, long gone now and probably never to return. But there are those who evoke his legacy. 

* Three Angled Blue's works popularized [the concept of Board-tans](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Board-tans), personifications of the 4chan Boards that fought against each other and were the symbolic personas of it's hivemind.

### Artists

Artists who continue the legacy of his detailed engravings.

* [SantanaDVX](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/112479-trollbait-nobody-is-right) - Created this magnificent work of satire at [the Strongside of Facepunch Studio Boards.](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=909314)
