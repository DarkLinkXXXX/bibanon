On July 6th, 2014, [a thread was posted on 4chan's /v/](https://archive.moe/v/thread/251948898/#251964684) that [proposed a comic idea](http://i.imgur.com/bjao8iF.png): _Imagine, "PC", the timeless immortal, doomed to watch his consoles... his progeny... rise and fall with the passage of time._

This thread [was rediscovered by a Tumblr user](http://planetofjunk.tumblr.com/post/91107928083/you-did-this-you-started-this-all) who (mistakenly) believed that [PlanetOfJunk](http://planetofjunk.tumblr.com/) (an artist known for drawing [Xbone-tan](http://imgur.com/a/PdSva)) drew the legendary SNES-tan OC.

From that point on... artists from around the internet worked to make that comic idea a reality. And the depiction of the PC as an anonymous strongman became ingrained in /v/'s imagination.

## Explanation

> In the pictures we see consoles in all stages of life, from young to old. PC is their parent, since essentially, all game consoles use a computer chip. PC guides them through the walks of life, teaching them the ways of gaming wisdom (though they never attain his divine nirvana).  
> And he creates new children to teach... [for he outlives all of his students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2ut3oj/sometimes_it_can_be_lonely_in_the_master_race/cobmqxm)
