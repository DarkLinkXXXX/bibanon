In 2007, a thread was posted on 4chan's /v/ [that proposed a comic idea](http://i.imgur.com/bjao8iF.png): _Imagine, "PC", the timeless immortal, doomed to watch consoles rise and fall with the passage of time._

This thread screencap was lost to time, until [it was rediscovered by a Tumblr user](http://planetofjunk.tumblr.com/post/91107928083/you-did-this-you-started-this-all) who (mistakenly) believed that [PlanetOfJunk](http://planetofjunk.tumblr.com/) (an artist known for drawing [Xbone-tan](http://imgur.com/a/PdSva)) drew the legendary SNES-tan OC.

From that point on... artists from around the internet worked to make that comic idea a reality. And the depiction of the PC as an anonymous strongman became ingrained in /v/'s imagination.
