On April 23 an Australian anon manages to get admin access and starts posting as moot. He posts the location of FWG, a french /int/ tripfag, ip's of mods and janitors and the password to the moderator IRC channel. Subsequently, 4chan was frozen for about 6 hours. 

The Bibliotheca Anonoma is attempting to record exactly what happened in the FWG Affair, since many of the Imgur galleries and DarkCave archive threads were expunged.

## The Context

## The Hack

* The hacker **obtained admin access on 4chan** and uses it to find all possible data on FWG, revealing some odd behavior, and also IP addresses of not just FWG: but even some moderators and janitors.
* The hacker **took control of Moot's capcode** and starts posting on 4chan with it for all leaks.
* The hacker **leaked new photos of /j/**, a special discussion board on 4chan for janitors and moderators. Since the password to the IRC channel was a sticky on the board, anons rush into the IRC Channel. 

### Archived 4chan Threads

Many of these were expunged. Must recover them somehow.

## The Aftermath

In a show of force, the anon posted as Moot ## Admin, causing immediate shitstorms all over 4chan.

Moot was particularly angry, especially as a similar breach of security had destroyed his startup, Drawquest and Canv.as. This was just one of a trifecta of tumultuous crises that would strike the heart of 4chan, and may have factored in his later retirement. 

## Sources

Thanks to the anons who posted these sources, or we would not have been able to recover the posts.
