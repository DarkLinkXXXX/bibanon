Shii is an important historical figure and primary source in the field of English-language anonymous forums, like [[world2ch]] and [[4chan]]. 

He served as one of 4chan's original moderators, but was overthrown during the crisis of the [[Civil War Era|4chan Civil War Era]]. He is also a major contributor to [[Wikipedia]], especially on those articles pretaining to [[Otaku]] culture and [[2channel]].

## Shii's Personal Wiki (DOWN)

> *As of 2013, Shii has deleted/disabled his wiki. The Bibliotheca Anonoma has released complete archive  here: <https://github.com/bibanon/everything-shii-knows>

Shii's wiki, called ["Everything Shii Knows"](http://shii.org/knows/), was one of the first major personal wikis in existence. It was created in his disgust with the decisions Wikipedia had to make in a choice between editing anarchy and bureaucratic uselessness. He suggested that people should instead make their own personal wikis, which could then be synced together; an idea we adopted when basing the Bibliotheca Anonoma on a git-based wiki.

Shii collected all the random stuff he wrote, and some important stories he archived from [[Wikichan]] on this personal wiki. His wiki was a direct inspiration for the work of the Bibliotheca Anonoma, and was the only surviving reference to Wikichan, another important inspiration.

That wiki contained all his personal essays on recent and past events and subjects, along with a collection of bits from Wikichan that would have been forgotten otherwise.

Most of his collected stories were already saved and reorganized on the Bibliotheca Anonoma, listed below:

* [[Nurse-kun|Damaged Goods]]
* [[Blindmute Loli]]
* [[American Dream]]
* [[From AOL Hacker to Businessman|AOHell]]
* [[The Great Scam]]
