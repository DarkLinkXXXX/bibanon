Marc Rebillet happens to be first in line for an iPhone, when an eBay scalper offers him $800 for his spot, planning to buy out the entire store's $100,000 worth of iPhones and sell them at extreme markup.

But the scalper should have read the fine print, that only one iPhone should be sold per customer. This is the very definition of having more money than brains. And Marc made the most profit out of the deal: he happened to be have friends who were 10th in line, so they got 2 iPhones and were $800 richer.
