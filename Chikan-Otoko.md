In 2005, an innocent 2ch user is mistaken for a 痴漢 (Train Molester), but manages to survive the accusation with a bit of charm. He becomes unfittingly dubbed the 痴漢男 (Chikan Otoko), or "Molester Man" (in a reference to [[Densha Otoko]]), and the woman is named (Miss Understanding), or Miss Undies for short (wtf). They continue to contact each other after the issue with resolved with the police, and thus the story of Molester Man begins.

Longer description incoming as this is researched, but it had a manga adaptation.
