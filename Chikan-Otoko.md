In 2005, an innocent 2ch user is mistaken for a 痴漢 (Train Molester), but manages to survive the accusation with a bit of charm. He becomes unfittingly dubbed the 痴漢男 (Chikan Otoko), or "Molester Man" (in a reference to [[Densha Otoko]]), and the woman is named (Miss Understanding), or Miss Undies for short (wtf). They continue to contact each other after the issue with resolved with the police, and thus the story of Molester Man begins.

Longer description incoming as this is researched, but it had a manga adaptation.

## Characters

* Molester Man
  * The main character of the story. He's a mediocre college student who regularly browses 2ch. He gets wrongly accused of stalking a girl when he tries to protect her from stalking. He posts his story to the VIP board of 2ch, in the distant hope of becoming the next Train Man (Densha Otoko) 

* Miss Understanding
  * The girl that Molester Man was trying to protect. It turns out that she had been a victim of stalking recently, and so was paranoid about people following her. She is friends with her co-workers, Kansai and Loli Jugs.

* Glasses
  * A "witness" that saw Molester Man trying to console Miss Understanding after she broke down crying from him chasing her. He helps resolve the issue with the police after Miss Understanding explained the situation. He sends a crab to Molester as an apology for the misunderstanding, but he disappears from the plot soon afterwards.
  
* Kansai
  * Miss Understanding's co-worker and friend. She is named Kansai because of her outgoing personality, not because she is from Kansai. She becomes friends with Molester Man after they discover some shared interests. She initially tries shipping Miss Understanding with Molester Man.

* Loli Jugs
  * Miss Understanding's other co-worker and friend. She had huge jugs, but Molester said that they didn't affect him because he preferred his girls 16 and under. Because of that, she was dubbed Loli Jugs
