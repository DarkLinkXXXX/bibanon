This is a community-editable report on the shitstorm unleashed by the Zoe Quinn scandal. The scandal has severe implications on the video game journalism industry, and even reveals a troubling insight into the power of forum moderators as gatekeepers of information. 

In response, major online communities launched united campaigns to protest the scandal, in a unique new way; attempting to bring public opinion on their side of the fence. 

Later on, extremists from either side of the conflict were marred in a grievious battle of attrition; launching destructive and wholly immoral attacks against each other and innocent individuals. No one has their hands clean here. And as the war drags on, it's slated to be as controversial as the Israel-Palestine conflict, with nary a moral leg to stand on.

As the situation goes on, we are going to need a solid, well sourced report of all that has happened; it’s truly an unprecedented event in internet history. 

The report should help anyone in the future understand why there was a reform in video game journalism, or how this longstanding conflict started; depending on how this all ends.

## TODO

What we need *daily* help on:

* Add more sources for every sentence to reference.
* Add the latest newsworthy events to the Timeline below.
    * [Some anon made a nice timeline in an image.](http://i.imgur.com/2GvxDVx.jpg) But text is obviously more searchable, updatable, and editable than an image, so help transcribe it and merge it into the BASC Timeline below. Here’s an [Automatic Transcript created by Google Tesseract OCR.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YYBEDfWUhfnrzyWGHVRZr1DciQOLhyV_KJuagcHV_U/edit)
    * There are other great info images worth importing. Check 4chan threads.
* Keep a record of all threads relating to the incident, from /v/, /pol/, etc. (see **4chan Threads** section below)
    * Even if the thread is past bump limit and is on page 10, record it. We can at least check the (foolz?) archives.
* Create a readable **General Report** describing the incident, and all that has happened (this will be the basis of the article at the BASC 4chan Chronicle).
* [http://pastebin.com/26ydmrES](http://pastebin.com/26ydmrES) Important shit right here (import information you see)
* Find a place for most/all links in OP posts from 4chan threads

* [[Quinnspiracy Censorship]] - A few moderators on major internet forums have reacted to the scandal by deleting threads about the topic. It's not as far-fetched as it sounds, since there are a wealth of plausible, well sourced reasoning behind such actions. However, it really goes to show just how much moderators influence the flow of information on the internet.
