## Inspirations and Forerunners

* [[Everything Shii Knows|Shii]] - Shii's Personal Wiki directly inspired the creation of the Bibliotheca Anonoma, since he had a small page of saved content from Wikichan and ED. His wiki was the only remaining reference to Wikichan before this wiki.
* [[Wikichan]] - A 4chan based wiki built by a task force to discover, archive, and present great stories from 4chan. Wikichan's task force practically invented the field of 4chan history, which was important as they worked before the rise of fuuka-archivers.
* [[Insurgency Wiki]] - A family of wikis made explicitly for the purpose of supporting Anonymous's many raids, before Operation Payback. It held a long pedigree of projects, dox, and raid history. Unfortunately, data was constantly lost due to deadbeat admins or the scourge of the Partyvan. Other groups managed to create mirrors or backups, but most were outdated and anons quickly lost interest. 
* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] - The famously controversial shock wiki built on raid culture and the ideal of parodying everything that can be documented on a wiki.
* [[LURKMOAR Wiki]] - The oldest 4chan wiki. It was inactive for many years due to the rise of the Partyvan and ED Wikis, but outlasted them both, and is seeing a bit of a revival today.
* YSWiki - The Yotsuba Society attempted to create a revived Wikichan, scraping whatever remained from the Internet Archive.
* [Vryd.net](http://dir.vyrd.net/) - Some anon that created his own personal database of 4chan content, some of which came from this wiki. Awesome guy.

## Installation and Editing

* [[Hosting]] - Want to host a mirror of the Bibliotheca Anonoma? Follow this guide and you'l have one up easily.
* [[Editing This Wiki]] - If you're mystified by how ikiwiki works and how to edit it, (it is a pretty unique wiki), never fear! Just read this guide and all will be fine and dandy.

## Design and Possible Modifications

* [[Help]] - details what needs to be done in this wiki.
* [[Fully Decentralized Wiki]] - A design specification for a fully distributed wiki, based on Gollum, a Web of Trust, a DVCS, and a p2p layer for that DVCS. It's similar to what [[Project Mayhem]] suggests with [[TYLER]]. The difference here is that we present and explore actual methods of making this wiki a reality, rather than simply focusing on the implications.

## Tools

*Stuff that we use to maintain the wiki. They need lots of work and attention.*

* [[BibAnon SDK]] - A set of portable tools that gives users a portable version of our wiki
* [[Mediawiki2Markdown]] - Our crappy little Mediawiki converting scripts. It's not perfect, and it causes a few problems with links, but it's the only thing we got.
