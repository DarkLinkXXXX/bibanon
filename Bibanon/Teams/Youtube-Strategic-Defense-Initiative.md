## What is this?

This is an initiative to back up the very best videos from Youtube in an organized manner in case disaster strikes. 

Their entire database is far too large for any direct dump (about 660 petabytes by 2011), but we can save the most vulnerable videos, and upload them to the Internet Archive.

Use [[Youtube-dl]] to download any YouTube, or even Vimeo videos with all metadata.
