Youtube Strategic Defense Initiative

## What is this?

This is an initiative to back up the very best videos from Youtube in an organized manner in case disaster strikes. 

Their entire database is far too large for any direct dump (about 660 petabytes by 2011), but don't be discouraged; just like any content, only a fraction of it needs to be saved.

That's still a large task before us, and even a few videos are too large to be saved on the Bibliotheca Anonoma. So instead, everyone should be responsible for a portion of the videos, to be uploaded to a torrent or shared later.

## How do I archive Youtube Videos?
