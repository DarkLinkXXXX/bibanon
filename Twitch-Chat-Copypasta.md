As of now, these are all taken from the [[4chan Cup]] chat. Some may only be pasta in that stream, while others may be common all around Twitch. More research needed.

For added fun, you can also copy the name of the person who started the pasta, leading to even longer strands of pasta.

### Literally Ass
This chat is awful, literally ass, except ass can bring pleasure, and this chat is the goddamn antithesis of pleasure. This chat takes life from children and kittens and puts that pure innocence into phallic cancer pus. This chat is disappointment and hate of humanity funneled into barely literate text that takes intelligence and shits all over it before making a shit sculpture out of the souls of everyone watching this whore of a stream. Everyone in this chat is the dregs of humanity, if even that, content with postulating whatever ass talk they can squeeze out of the withered rectum of their wasted lives.

### Did X Already Lose
I'm sorry, but did /sp/ already lose? Oh, that's right. The game isn't even over yet. In fact, it's only halftime. Does not having the lead at halftime count as a loss? Is that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong. Why would you make this topic when the game is still on?

### Carbonara Recipe
That's not the correct way to do carbonara, the proper way is eggs, cream, parmesan, salt, and pepper into the sauce, all whisked together, then chop up the pancetta and a few cloves of garlic nice and small, then when it's ready to go get the spaghetti into the water and shortly after start the pancetta, no oil (the fat is enough) in a wok, then when that's getting there add in the garlic and once they're done turn off the heat and let them sit in the wok until the pasta's done, at which point strain the pasta then add to the wok, mix it up and pour in the sauce, mix it in and in the likely event that there's liquid in the bottom then put the heat on low and continue mixing it in until the sauce has been reduced to the correct amount, not congealed but not pooling either, then serve while still warm and top with salt, not pepper or parmesan (that's just barbaric!).Really, what would italians know about carbonara anyway?

### Attack-Helicopter-kin
I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding
