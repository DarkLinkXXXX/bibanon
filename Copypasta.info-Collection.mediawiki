== 4chan unban appeal ==

Dear /b/, was I naïve to think this would unban me on NIGGERTITS? pic unrelated Good day modders / owners of 4chan.com,

Firstly, let me tell you that my ban, in principle, was just and that I wasn't using Tor at the moment it was filed, neither do I posses a dynamic IP.

The reason I was banned was for posting child pornography, of which I was pretty much unaware. It happened a few days ago, at March 8th 2008 to be exact.

I will try to simulate what I said as good as I can, for I cannot memorize exactly what I typed. It all originated by a conversation on Xfire: I got a link in Xfire from a friend of mine named "Max" (Note: this is not his actual Xfire username.) To a video on YouTube, depicting children from, I think the age of either 12-15 (I cannot confirm this, throughout the entire video there was a vagina for about a minute or two, no faces - just voices.) First I thought this video must have been fake, for it was YouTube after all - as far as I know there are no pornographic videos on this site, and it would be strictly forbidden to post them.

Without any further consideration I went to 4chan, the /b/ board to be exact and there I made a new topic, stating ; CPTUBE DELIVERS! with a Pedobear image, in which Pedobear gasped with eyes wide open. and underneath the link towards the video on YouTube. This was probably already the point of no return.

The fact is that I was pretty much unaware about the fact that light child pornography (although I thought this was fake after all, I am not in the possession of anything related to child pornography - nor did I have the intent to post anything of the likes) was entirely forbidden on this site - as far as I know and heard 4chan has no rules at all, but it seems that I was wrong. I have been visiting 4chan for about a week or two, and in these past weeks I came across a variety of topics posting children with somewhat funny notes like "But I poop from there!", accompanied by a lot of Pedobear images - I thought this was rather hilarious.

As this was YouTube I considered the video to be harmless - the video came from YouTube, a popular, respected streaming site containing many videos, but none of them circulating around pornography or anything in those lines because this is forbidden. Neither am I a person to enjoy anything in line with child pornography. I am a healthy heterosexual who has no interests in this. I only posted for amusement of others (at which I probably failed, sadly - and also resulting in a most fearsome permanent ban.) After I posted the video, yes after - I asked my friend Max, where he got the video from - he linked me to another post on 4chan, and he also explained me that this wasn't fake, and I realized at that point that I was very stupid to believe it was. I'm pretty new to 4chan, I absolutely love the /b/ board, and as there are no rules at all I thought I could post just about anything I wanted to - but it seems that I crossed the line - and let me apologize for being inconsiderate, I acted hastily. I would be very disappointed if this ban will not be lifted. In the future, if you are so kind to lift the ban that is, I will abide by the rules and make sure I think before I post, also it will be easy to track me down if I do not keep my own promise - I have a static IP address, so banning me again permanently will be incredibly easy.

I hope I did not take too much of your time, and let me apologize again for my stupidity. 4chan is a great website. I put a lot of effort in my plea, and I hope it has been enough to make you change your mind, if it necessary Max can confirm the content of this story. I give you my regards, Anonymous

(PS: If I made any spelling mistakes, I'm sorry I could not root those out, English is not my first language after all.)

== Anime is not for nerds ==

For nerds? Well excuse me... Some people grew up with it and is part of there culture aka asians. Also its a good thing to do when ur bored. + your list of anime is prob less thn 0.001% of whats actually on the market. Not all anime are or children and nerds there are large varietys targeted at different groups. Also teen titans is not really anime tho drawn in a very similar/same style as anime. There are certain rules it does not follow making it a cross breed And yes i am awfully offended at your steriotyping. Thankyou. P.s. and no animes not just about hentai... Add more variety to your gallery... 

== Anon is fail ==

Hey guise! guess wut! The other chans failing is due to the same reason youre failing! tl dr? try to keep up. Now, a big steaming pile of you chonners are leaderless, homeless, angry, and rejected. Hmmm. Do any of you dummies even possess any computer skills? I see fail in here every time I check. "Hey has anyone taken these?" stupid drug questions are ubiquitous. Gb2w/e is omnipresent. anon will not amount to anything, you cant even pull together for a simple task of destroying a cult. Even Maddox could've owned Enkindlers already, if he chose to. Usenet makes you idiots look like, well, not even simple script kiddies. Usenet is the big leagues. why dont you faceless anon sissies graduate now that your penis has shriveled up? Every last one of you weirdos know you only posess any influence in these chons. all of you experience fail IRL perpetually. Oh, wait I forgot. a bunch of 15 yr olds posting pics of mediocre JB from facebook are gonna change the world! Ooooh what a force to be reckoned with. Your Fuhrur Kirt was pwned from another continent away. No one cares about you, not even you. Youve made no impact. Your faceless leaderless digital revolution FAILD. The only ppl who think anon is cool is noofag anon wannabes, no one likes them, no one likes you, and you're used to it. Hmm. nice life you've carved for yourselves. Longcat is an opossum in drag, Chris Hansen is in your ports, killin' all your doods, furfags actually torment you in the rest of the interwebs, and you STILL haven't managed to make a dent in Enkindlers. you better just keep praying you don't piss real 373371575 off. Usenet mutherfuckers will netbusfuck you. Buncha weeaboos, furfags, and Dragonball Z fans. anon = ricers who are too young and/or nerdy to get laid... Pathetic. Please fuckin ban me. If i ever come back here I want to be reminded how awesome you nerds are compared to me... on the internet. Meanwhile, Im gonna record my big titty GF chocking on my 8 1/2 in. of pipe on my cellphone and NOT post it here, because you guys have too much banning to do. enjoy your misery shiteaters :)

== Atari E.T. ==

Most gamers know the story of the hundreds of thousands of E.T. cartridges Atari crushed, encased in concrete, then buried in Alamogordo, New Mexico. What most gamers don’t know is who Atari buried along with them... 

== Atheist extremists ==

Atheist extremists fail just as bad as christian extremists.

Stop using the internet to try to change my mind about GOD. I believe in god that doesn't make me stupid or a bible humper it makes you a fag for trying to indoctrinate me and millions of others.Yeah I believe in god but I also believe in freedom to do what I want and think how I want without discrimination.Besides everyone knows that a little Christianity kicks ass,because us Christians have Christmas, the best fucking holiday ever.And if your and atheist and you celebrate Christmas then your a fucking hypocrite!So no present for you! 

== Autistic girlfriend ==

3 years ago, I met the young lady you see here. We started going out. No one else would go out with her because of her mild autism. She is completely antisocial but since she respected me, I talked to her on the Internet and she basically declared her feelings for me in the setting she always found most comfortable. We have been happily together now for 3 years, and a year ago I moved in with her at the request of her parents. She is really hard to deal with, but I enjoy doing things for her.

Her parents are fairly rich and they finance our living. They've effectively hired me to live with her and take care of her. They just wanted her out of their hair now that she's an adult. I'm not really doing it for the money, we live modestly and the only payment I receive is the food I eat and the roof over my head. I've learned to enjoy giving my time and love to her even if she doesn't always reciprocate.

As for the sex life, it can be rather dull. She can take care of herself for the most part, but will forget the little things. She's afraid to go outside alone or drive. She's afraid to try new things in general. Sometimes I have to remind her to brush her teeth or shower, but there is something to be said for a girl who's a little musky. It's rewarding because I can bathe her myself.

At first it was hard to deal with her, but then I realized that women are children first and partners second. I think of her not only as a passionate lover and friend, but also as a student.

I use the computer a lot less than I used to, I devote most of my time to her happiness now, and I feel much better for it.

I'll take your questions but I don't have all the answers. 

== Autobiographical account of the chain of events ==

I am presenting you with an autobiographical account of the chain of events that incited a chaotic, topsy-turvy time in my life. I beg of you to remain within a close proximity for but a scant few moments as I recount how I metamorphosed into the heir apparent of the municipality referred to as Bel-Air, California.

Amidst the occident of Philadelphia I had been sprung to life and had been nourished. A lion's share of my youth and adolescence was consumed by the outdoor entertainment facilities at the park. Carousing with my pals, merrymaking to my maximum ability, and unwinding, I often partook in a friendly match of basketball at the schoolhouse's arena.

It was during one of these excursions that a pair of rabble-rousing fellows instigated malevolence. I took part in nothing but a single skirmish, yet my mother became immersed in fear, at which point she commanded me to transfer my residence from her dwelling to that of my aunt and uncle in Bel-Air, California.

I proceeded to hail a taxi and, upon its arrival, I made out an inscription on the license plate that read "FRESH" and was intrigued by a pair of dice draped over the rearview mirror. If nothing else, a claim could be made that this particular taxi was atypical; however, I came to the conclusion that recollecting this occasion in the future would be a fruitless venture, so in lieu of attempting to implant this incident within my memory, I implored the chauffeur to transport me to my destination of Bel-Air, California.At approximately the seventh or eighth hour, I disembarked and proceeded to inform the driver that I would inevitably become acquainted with his odor at a later point in time.

At this juncture, I beheld my new abode and came to grips with the fact that my mission to become the heir apparent in Bel-Air, California, had been consummated. 

== Bento box ==

I'm looking for a bento box, it cant be pinku (that's Japanese for pink) or any girl color. It has to be of 2 or more kotoba (that's Japanese for 2 compartments) and has be be chibi (small) sized. And has to be really kawaii (cute). Also It has to be about 10-20 bux. And you have to post pics of it first (i want to make shure it's kawaii [cute]). And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (Korea) or whatever. I have found a bento box similar to the one im describing in e-bay, but it was 1 kotoba, and i don't want my gohan (rice) to touch my other things (it can get wet and i would not like that, plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii) 

== Better than you ==

Hey, /b/tards!

I don’t know what’s wrong with you guys, seriously! You all bawwww about not having girlfriends, lives or any other shit. But here’s the truth:

-I have a girlfriend; she’s really hot. And I mean REALLY.

-I play keyboard. None of your shitty emo music, no. I play stuff people enjoy SOCIALLY.

-I have TONNES of friends, male and female. I’m funny, smart, and friendly.

-I get good grades. I’m going to get rich, while you faggots sit in your basements.

The best bit? I spend about 4 hours a day on here, and have done for about a year. I’m one of you, but not. I’m everything you want to be, but aren’t.

Pic is me. I got rid of my face, because I don’t want you freaks fapping to me. 

== Bitches don't know about my fetuses ==

If i was a girl, i would get pregnant as many times as possible, then have abortions after the third month of being pregnant so i would deliver a potato sized 1/3 developed dead fetus, then i would take the fetus, put it in a jar of preservative liquid and put it on a shelf in a secret room in my house, and i would do it until i﻿ had so many that the rooms walls were nothing but potato sized aborted fetuses, then i would have a kid and when they're bad i would make them sit in the fetus room. 

== Blackie ==

Hey /b/. I don't mean to sound like a racist, But what the hell is up with black youth? I ask this because of a few events that happened today. I was sitting in my English class this afternoon when a knock sounded at the door. Mind you, this took place about a half hour AFTER class started. Lo and Behold the person knocking was the only black student in my class. This is the first time this week that he actually showed up for class, and he sauntered in like he was early for class. He took a seat rather noisily and basically caused the class to pause until he settled down and finished saluting his homies. Class continued as normal until assignments were handed out. That is when he started to speak. My god, /b/, I have never heard a more blabbering, mumbling person speak in my life. I couldn't understand a damn thing coming out of his mouth. The few things I DID understand were him asking the difference between an "illusion" and "allusion", and his apparent hatred for homonyms. After the misunderstanding was cleared he then went on about how 'bling' his shoes were until the class ended. During the class he also claimed that the name '50 Cent' is a metaphor. So I ask this of you /b/, why can't black people learn to speak and/or pay attention? Why do they care more about their 90$ piece of shit 'bling' batman shoes than learning? I live in a town where there are at most 20 black people, and 90% of the ones I've been in the same room with could fit right in with the racial stereotype. 

== Brats ==

I hope I'm not the only one who is seeing the Hideous and extremely disgraceful Dress Code and additude of our young teens of today! These kids have no idea how fortunate they are to have such a wonderful life they have to live in! Ya know what?, the Blame falls on the PARENTS! What's the matter with you Damn mother and fathers?!! Have you forgot how many lives have been lost so we can walk around in our towns and cities that have not been Bombed to rubble! Maybe you're just to Stupid and uneducated to realize how fortunate we are these days! I have seen your kids Drop papers, cups and anything else they don't want right on the ground as if this is what to do! Most of you Stupid people don't even care what your ugly kids do as long as they are out of your way! Most of you parents aren't even Qualified to be Parents, you lazy Morons! Why don't you teach your selves how to respect what you have and maybe your Brat kids will catch on! MAYBE! The small amount of the good kids go unnoticed because the Majority of you inconsiderate Brats, prevent them from being seen! You parents probably allow your brats to do whatever they want in your own homes! The other bad thing is, most likely the good parents will be the only ones who read this Blog! Those of you who are the good Parents, will know that you are and I commend you for your efforts! Thank You!

== Dad and hot daughter's boyfriend ==

I feel like my daughter is becoming too slutty, she's only 15 and she's very pretty, but it's being marred by the ridiculous clothes she wears out, all the make up she wears, and how all she ever talks about is boys and the way she looks. I may sound very protective but she's my only child and I really love her.

The other day my little girl brought this guy over, and I was really worried because he seemed a lot older (he is 2 grades higher than her at school) and he was rude and seemed to not really care about her that much. It really made my blood boil and got me really angry, when he left the next day I was sitting on the couch watching a bowie concert DVD, and made the decision to not say goodbye or look at him once, but this was really weird, he came over to me, and sat next to me. Now my daughter was still upstairs (he said she was on the computer or something) and my wife was shopping.

He seemed totally different from the previous day, and was really friendly, of course I was suspicious and started talking about what a nice person my daughter is (which is 100% true I must say). He moved closer to me on the couch and patted me on the thigh like a football player or something, but then slowly moved his hand further up my leg. He smelt like butterscotch and I'd just noticed how attractive he was (I think how critical I was of him stopped me from picking this up). Now I don't see myself as gay at all, I mean growing up and at uni I was one of those liberal guys, experimented with drugs and both sexes but that had since faded. However this was different.

I was really attracted to him, and he was so forward, I pulled him in and kissed his neck then I heard this knock on the window and pulled away straight away. It was my wife she'd forgot the house key, and was knocking on the window to get someone to open the door to let her in...she spotted us as I pulled away and ran to the door, opened it but really I had no chance at explaining, my wife kicked us both out in one of those crushing scenes, what was I to do, where was I to go, I was out on my fanny.

So over the bridge from Flushing to the Sheffield's door, he was there to sell make up but the father saw more I had style, I had flair, I was there, that's I she became the Nanny.

Who would have guessed that the guy we described was just exactly what the doctor prescribed?

Now, the father finds her beguiling, watch out C.C., The kids are actually smiling, such joie de vivre, I'm the ladyboy in red when everybody else is wearing tan. The flashy guy from Flushing, the Nanny named Fran. 

== Deep Python is not amused by your faggotry ==

Alright you shits, listen well and listen good.

I cannot go a single fucking page on /v/ without seeing somebody baaaawwing over the fucking Super Mario 64 eel.

>I HATE HIM BECAUSE HE IS SCARY AND HE IS SCARY
>YOU RUINED MAH CHILDHOOD BAWWW
>I HATE WATER LEVELS BECAES YOU
>I HAVE A PHOBIA OF WATER AND EELS NOW, PLEASE FEEL SORRY FOR ME CRAAAAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIIIN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIN

Well I’m fucking tired of it. You niggers wouldn’t know fear if it fucked you in the ass. Nobody even remembers me, the Deep Python. I bet half the people reading this right now just remembered running out of magic and realizing they were fucked because they didn’t know the seahorse could lead you to Pinnacle Rock a second time. Yeah, that’s right. I was all over the fucking walls while you were still figuring out how to swim as Mikau. I’d eat you within a second, and bye-bye two hearts. You kept on trying to attack my head because that’s what you’d normally do. Sorry bitch, that’s how I get you close to my mouth. Just like I got my own Deep Python close to your mom’s mouth last night. And speaking of night, you were trying to kill me for so long that it passed into night while you were at the bottom of the fucking ocean. Your little seven-year-old ass couldn’t see shit, and you were scared to fucking death because of it. And the worst part of it was, you’d have no idea how many of me you were going to have to kill before you got all the eggs.

In closing, I am the greatest video game eel to ever exist. I am deceptive, numerous, frightening, and powerful. Is your OH SO SCARY Mario 64 eel any of that? No, no it isn’t. So the next time I see someone asspained about that little red dickflap, I will repost this to show them the error of their ways. It will eventually become a common copypasta, being posted everywhere. Then you’ll all remember. Oh yes. You’ll remember.

Peace out faggots. Pic related, it’s me about to open a can of whoopass.

== Dennis ==

The worst emotion, by far, is Dennis. Feeling Dennis is probably the least pleasurable experience in the world. You're always upset, you can't be happy when you're Dennis. Problem is, whenever one person is Dennis, the other people he comes into contact with also become Dennis. This leads on to the point, where DID Dennis originate from? Was it originally portrayed by a lonely old man, or a hobo? Thing is, there is no definite answer, due to the tracing going back thousands and thousands of years. Which brings up the topic, how can you stop feeling Dennis when you're already Dennis? There are a number of ways to alleviate this problem, such as carpooling and playing video games. Though, the only surefire way to remove this feeling is to break the seams of a voodoo doll, spill out the entrails into a bowl of trail mix and eat your life away. I hope this answers your question. 

== Disgusting pigs ==

I was just linked here from a thread on Gaia, and I must say a few things...

1. You guys are racist, sexist, homophobic PIGS. 2. You are the representation of all that is wrong in this world. 3. DISGUSTING FUCKING PEDOPHILES, SICK BASTARDS. 4. You all need to DIE. 5. STAY OUT OF GAIA.

IF YOU TRY TO SAY OTHERWISE, I WILL GIVE YOU SUCH A VERBAL BEATING YOUR SELF ESTEEM WILL DROP TO THE NEGATIVES. 

== Dogs vs. cats ==

I don't get it. Why does /b/ make such a fuss about cats? Cats are souless creatures that only care about you when they're hungry. They kill other small animals for amusement. They piss everywhere. They shit everywhere. They whine. And then they fuck off for a few hours, only to come back looking for food again. In my opinion, dogs are better. Sure, they can't climb walls. And sure, some dogs can be a bit dumb. But you can't find anything as loyal and protective as a family dog.

tl;dr fuck cats and I mean that. 

== Doodlebops ==

Let's say the Doodlebops perform at your local performance center, and you're an attendee. The crowd and audience is rather violent, plagued by fights, bypassed weapons, drinking, and drugs. The Doodlebops play their opening song "We're the Doodlebops" and while the two Doodlebops ask where their fellow Doodlebop, Moe, is, Moe bolts back on the stage. A man throws a broken bottle at Moe, which angers him. Moe then produces what appears to be a .45-caliber semi-automatic Glock handgun, as the beat of the rythmn progresses, and unloads all 10 of the bullets in its magazine. You get hit by four of the 10 rounds, two of them hitting your head. Six other people are injured, three by gunshot wounds, and the other three by the panicing stampede. All three gunshot victims and a stampede victim are treated, and are released sometime by the next week, but you are in the hospital for weeks.

How would you deal with the situation knowing your life has been threatened with bullets? How do you want to get back at Moe, who is now imprisoned and awaiting trail on attempted murder, assault and weapon charges? 

== Dutch jail ==

I'm posting from prison in the Netherlands. Netherlands is soft as fuck - we are allowed to have internets in prison, single cells, no bumraep. I got 9 months for trying to rob a mail office with a watergun with a traffic cone on my head (i got sued by the receptionist who i hurt with the cone).

Netherlands is win. I might just do it again - it's just like home (sittin' on /b/ all day), but i don't have to work, clean or cook (The food is decent). Only problem is I'm next to some fuckwad's cell who starts making loud comments about "The holy lord" when I'm watching porn with sound on (they don't allow headphones). He got in here for beating a gay up.

Fuck. V& isn't so bad here. 

== Eight days of misery ==

Hello, /b/. It’s time that I admit I am Jewish. I have kept this secret for a long time, but I must come clean. I cannot keep lying to you, because that means I am lying to myself. I must also admit that I am of the Jewish faith so that I can tell you about my Hanukkah. It may have been the worst eight days of my life.

Day One: Day one seemed to go normally, except when I called my girlfriend Jessica, she did not answer. Confused, I asked my brother Jack if he knew anything that might be happening with her. He did not clearly answer me, just shrugged and mumbled some shit.

Day Two: When Jessica came over, she seemed to be ignoring me a lot. I kept trying to talk to her, but she acted like I did not even exist. "Come on, Jessica," I pleaded. "What's wrong?" She whipped around and glared at me. "God, Jeremy! Why won't you give me any space!" That hurt more than any physical pain I could imagine.

Day Three: I could really tell something was amiss, so I asked everyone I knew about it. At first they did not respond, but eventually my mother tearfully admitted something to me. “It’s your brother,” she said. “He’s been sleeping with Jessica.” I shook my head, in the warm comfort of my denial. "No way," I claimed. "Jack would never do something like that." "It's true," said my mother. "Oh, God, I'm so sorry, Jeremy." I went to my room without a word.

Day Four: I had to absorb this knowledge overnight before I could confront Jack. On day 4 I finally did. "Why did you sleep with Jessica!?" I demanded. "Who told you!?" "Mom did." Jack sighed. "Oh, man, I begged her not to tell anyone else." I ignored his pathetic excuse. "How could you, Jack? You're my brother!" As he opened his mouth, I got so pissed off at his fucking face and that huge, stereotypical Jewish nose, that I slammed my fist straight into it. Jack fell backwards screaming, then kicked my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. We came to blows, beating at each other until my dad managed to separate us.

Day Five: Jack and I still refused to speak to each other. Jessica called me twice, but I ignored that cheating whore!

Day Six: This day remains imprinted in my memory. I sat down and talked with Jessica. "Why would you do this to me?" I asked. "I don't know, Jeremy. I-I love him!" I could not handle this. It was as if my arm had a mind of its own. It snapped up and slapped my hand across her face. Jessica looked at me in shock, then ran away. I actually cried that night.

Day Seven: I remained in my room for most of the seventh day of Hanukkah, not speaking to anyone, contemplating what to do.

Day Eight: On the eighth day, I finally figured out how to solve the problem. After waking up, I laid in bed until everybody else was up. I stood and grabbed the switchblade from my dresser. Placing it in my pocket, I went downstairs. There I saw Jack next to the Hanukkah candles. "Hey," I said quietly. Finally, I really spoke to him. "Jack, we shouldn't keep this grudge up over Hanukkah. Come on. We need to make our peace." Jack nodded soberly. I looked over at the candle. "Come on. Let's light the candle, Jack." We lifted the match to the eighth candle, and just as the flame lit, I pulled out my switchblade and stabbed hi 

== Enter the Windows ==

hello anon is it possible to make a program that displays the packets of the internet onto your screen i mean like in matrix the format would be hexadecimal and the color green. 

== Epic infected leg rape fuck ==
Hello, /b/.

I started college really early: at 13, back in fall 1992. Needless to say, when the web came on the
scene I was all over it. Before that I was fapping to shit from Usenet and Gopher. I remember putting my
old 286 and its 2400 baud modem to work in the late eighties, but back then I wasn't that interested in
porn yet.

But and so once I got my BITNET account at Penn during a summer program in '91 it was game fucking on. I
am here to tell you 17 years later that the copypasta on /b/ pales in comparison to what was on
alt.sex.stories. And as a 12-year old I cannot think but that this had some effect on me. Let me explain.
I'd pretended to be a lesbian online back in the days of CompuServe as a preteen and I'd managed to find
some sick stories and even a few pics back before the early Mosaic days (back then it was mostly
alt.sex.binaries FTW). But any retard could see that more and better was yet to come. And Mosaic opened
up a whole new world.

Looking back, I remember the first time I saw scat. It was in the main computer center at around 10 pm
on a Friday night (I lived in the Quad on campus). I was there with another dude who would probably be a
/b/tard nowadays and we stared at the screen slackjawed. But and so it was a picture of a woman who
literally had a shit-eating grin. When I saw this I thought that was the worst thing on the Internet. I
was wrong.

Later on came the day when I saw a man fuck a chicken. During my math lab (I was taking a CCH calculus
class, not the classical kind). I couldn't quite look, but I couldn't stop looking either. Fuck doing my
MAPLE assignment, I was hooked. Yet I knew that this was still just the tip of the iceberg.
At this point it might help to mention that kids in college are granted a bit of leeway by their fellow
students. Generally an avuncular interest is taken in their emotional development. Liquor is generally
not offered, but parties are (or they were to me, anyway). You see certain things that you might see in
high school too, but they resonate a bit more when adults (to put it loosely) are participating.
Anyway, the end of my freshman year (I had gone part-time for a year) I had started taking grad classes.

The age gap between me and my fellow students had only grown wider. After they'd gotten to know me,
though, some of them took me under their collective wing. And one day early in my sophomore year a few
of the grad students apparently thought it would be funny to play a little joke on me.
One of them (I'll call him "Alpha" here because he was one of the few alpha male mathematicians I've
ever met - though he wasn't very good: I actually had to help him with a lot of problems about de Rham
cohomology that semester) was a real sick fuck, a man I looked up to then and still do today. Anyway, he
suggested that I walk up to some of the younger coeds (who, mind, would be some four or five years
older) and proposition them while he and his buddies looked on from afar. Lulz (he didn't use the term,
of course, since this was quite a few years ago) would ensue, I was assured. He promised they'd make it
worth my while, and I figured I'd go along with it.

Now, the day before I had experienced a rather epic wank session that culminated in viewing some fairly
outré material, even by my standards. I had actually printed up the pictures so I could fap to them on
campus in the bathroom between classes. I decided to work this stuff into my pitch to the chicks,
because they'd probably just think it was a joke. I figured the grad students would have my back if
anything went wrong, and if it went right then I might meet the girl of my dreams.

So right after I agree, I see an obvious freshman walking my way, about six inches shorter than me (I
was pretty tall, especially for my age), decent body, pretty but not in an obvious way. So I go up to
her and mumble "Wanna...uh...have sex?" in front of the grad students. They struggle not to lose it. She
does a double-take, then looks at me sideways. Asks me what I'm doing there. I tell her. She pauses,
then takes my hand firmly and starts leading me in the direction she'd been walking in before. A peal of
laughter rang out behind me.

It was warm and the girl was wearing denim shorts and a t-shirt. She had sun-bleached brown hair, green
eyes and a few small blemishes, not bad. She looked a little bit like a young Courtney Thorne-Smith. As
we walked I took this all in and didn't really think about what could go right. I thought for a moment
that she was going to tell my parents but then I realized that was retarded and that there was nobody to
tell. Then she asked me again if I was a student. I flashed my university ID. She seemed to make a
decision then.

I thought again of the stuff I'd seen on the web the night before. I thought real hard. I tried to
imagine her doing it. With me. I started to say something, but my voice cracked. She looked back at me:
we were in a parking lot by now. I faltered and she started leading me again. We got into her car. I
still remember it: a white '91 Corolla with Mardi Gras beads hanging from the rearview.

The sunlight refracted through the beads and they lit up, casting colored shadows across her face. (I
couldn't help but remind myself that the index of refraction for the beads was probably about the same
as for glass or water, which struck me as odd somehow right then.) She touched the steering wheel and
let out a little yelp: it was late spring and the inside of the car was hot. I looked away from her as I
put on my seat belt and tried again to work up my courage.

But I chumped out again. Even asking her if she wanted to have sex was something that had required a
tremendous amount of will on my part, and I was already emotionally exhausted. She turned to me again
and said "You sure you're 14?" and I just nodded weakly. She put the car in drive and we left the
campus. Without thinking, I started to mention that I had a class in an hour. She just giggled and put
in a Radiohead CD.

The drive took like 5 or 10 minutes. En route she asked me what my major was and I said math. She
laughed, saying "of course" and put her hand on my knee at the same time, then just concentrated on her
driving. She told me her name, said she hadn't decided on a major yet but that it sure wouldn't be math.
She asked if I could tutor her and laughed again, but gave me a winning smile at the same time. I slowly
began to realize that she was trying to put me at ease. It didn't matter that I had approached her. She
knew I was in over my head.

She lived in a small three-bedroom house just off campus, not far from Spruce. Her roommates were
supposedly away until that night. She opened the front door and I followed her in and put my backpack
down on a couch. There were beer and tequila bottles on the kitchen counter and pizza boxes on the
coffee table. She and her roommates had taken lots of Polaroids from their parties and put them up in a
hallway near the front. She told me she'd be in the shower, and to relax and make myself comfortable. I
didn't know what I had gotten myself into. My heart was racing. I was sweating.
At this point I was really thirsty and nervous. Clearly at least a beer was needed. I went to the fridge
and found some Jello shots and washed them down with some Pepsi. That did the trick. Then I started
thinking again about what I'd seen the night before.

I heard the shower turn off and then heard her asking if I was OK. I answered with a weak "yeah" and
moments later she came out in a Tweety Bird robe and told me to take a shower myself while she took care
of a few things. I left my backpack in the living room and went into the bathroom. Locked the door.
Looked at myself in the mirror. I couldn't believe what was happening. I told myself I had to follow
through, that I had to go for it.

Now I don't know if any of you are underage b& but I remember that I was pretty fast in those days. So I
figured I should churn one out beforehand to play it safe. And then I wished I had a rubber. But I
figured "fuck it" and as the shower started I thought about her and the pictures and fapped a fast one
and cleaned up.

When I turned the shower off, I heard her rummaging around through some drawers. I said "I'll be out in
a minute" and my voice cracked again. I could start to feel the Jello shots taking hold, and I started
to relax a little bit. Let me tell you it was good fucking timing because otherwise I'd never have had
the nerve to do what I did a little bit later.

So I grabbed a towel and left my clothes in there, figuring I'd just roll with it. I walked out into the
hallway with the Polaroids and stopped when I saw one of the grad students--that sick fuck Alpha--on the
couch, talking to the girl. She was standing with one leg bent, arms akimbo, a towel on her head. I
couldn't hear what they were whispering.

Anyway Alpha noticed me first. There was actually another grad student there with him that I hadn't seen
from the hallway. All three of them were looking at me now. I started to speak, but Alpha got up and
walked over to me. He put an arm around me and walked me over to the couch, saying, "This is for you,
big guy."

So Alpha starts talking to me about how he and his buddies had pooled their money and got me a call
girl. The catch was that they wanted to watch me fuck her. They seemed to have built this up as some
coming-of-age ritual in their minds when really they just wanted to watch me getting laid. I looked at
her and she just raised her eyebrows a bit and smirked knowingly.

Now at this point I got real nervous fast, and I guess it was obvious to all of them. I stopped thinking
about doing weird shit and started thinking about getting the fuck out of there. But the girl put her
hand on my shoulder and said it was OK, there was nothing to worry about. She said she was clean and
worked as a call girl to pay for tuition, she wasn't dirty and this wasn't dirty, and I should enjoy it.
She said she'd fucked in front of other people and it was hotter anyways. She said I'd like it.
By now I'd had a chance to collect my thoughts. I figured I knew these guys pretty well by now. And I
started thinking again I might as well go for it. I knew what I wanted and I knew it would probably blow
their minds--including the girl. It'd serve them right: after all, a call girl was pretty cool, but it
was also kind of condescending. And I hated that shit.

Now in those days I had to fap a lot, especially being around all those hot older college chicks.
Otherwise, I'd've been a walking hard-on. So I actually had the printouts in my backpack. I said "fuck,
let's do it" and clapped my hands. My backpack was right there. I unzipped it and pulled out the
pictures I'd printed up the night before and showed them to the girl. I didn't say anything, just
lowered my head a little while raising my eyebrows. Questioning her. Daring her.
Her eyes narrowed and she turned slowly from the pictures to look at me, a little incredulous. The grad
students couldn't see the pictures, which was how I wanted it. She seemed to have figured this out on
her own, and I could tell she was concentrating. After a couple of seconds she just whispered "yeah, we
can try that" and she walked over to a closet and started looking through it. She seemed a little dazed.
The grad students were clearly fascinated, but I wasn't going to spoil the surprise. I stuffed the
pictures in the backpack and put it on the couch again. By now she seemed to have found what she was
looking for in the closet. She said "come here" and when I approached (the grad students' feet seemed to
be glued to the floor, thankfully) she asked "will this work?" I looked in the closet and was pleasantly
surprised myself.

Then I looked at her and I realized that she must have known about this sort of thing already. (How? It
didn't seem like she'd done it before, and she was suddenly as nervous as I was.) And that on the most
fundamental level she understood me. At that instant we shared something beautiful and terrifying. Time
slowed somehow. I took her hand. The other grad student asked from the living room "what the hell are
you guys doing? Are you going to show us or what?" She smiled at me. We put it in a Gap bag from the
closet and I said "Come and see" as she led me to the bedroom.
Her bedroom was small, but it was surprisingly classy. Like an oasis in the house. No posters, just a
few decent watercolors of plants that she'd probably done herself. A decent matching bedroom set, modern
cherry. A few bottles of perfume and some cosmetics, one of those old Bose Wave CD players and a few
CDs, mostly jazz. A few plants. It was the sort of bedroom a yuppie might have, not a college freshman.
By now she had put her bag on the bed, and it had tipped over and revealed its contents. The grad
students were just outside coming in. Alpha said "All ri-" and stopped cold when he glanced at what was
on the bed. It was just a videotape, but it was the packaging that had grabbed his attention. The other
grad student looked at it and said "That isn't real..." He kept looking, faltered, then raised his
widening eyes to me: "Are you fucking kidding me?"

At that point she told both of them to please leave. The other grad student said "what the fuck? We paid
fo-" but Alpha silenced him with a flicker of his eyes. She turned around, opened her nightstand drawer,
and counted out a few twenties, it seemed like $200 or so. She handed the money to the other grad
student and stared at him wordlessly. Both of the grad students looked at me. Alpha just said "fair
enough", looked me in the eyes calmly, and gave my shoulder a little punch as he walked out. The other
one followed him out, disgusted twice over. I heard them leave through the front door. She smiled at me
and took my hand.

I will return to this moment, but the narrative will be more coherent if I skip ahead with a few jumps
first. So bear with me.

I didn't see any of the grad students the next day: our classes only met three times a week, and I was
recovering that day anyway. So by the time I went into a class two days afterward, word had gotten
around. I had been apprehensive about seeing them again, but she'd told me not to worry. Even if they
talked about it, nobody would take the tape seriously, she'd said. And she was right. When I walked in
the classroom and waved goodbye to her (she'd come along with me since she had a class nearby, but she
ducked out and walked away quickly before anyone could stop her) the guys just about jumped out of their
chairs and started high-fiving me. A moment later the professor walked in and just winked at me, then
started drawing a commutative diagram. The events of two days before faded into legend.
Alpha and I became genuinely close friends after that. I eventually found out that he came from money
and he said he was going to quit after he got his MS and start learning the family business (they had a
big sea freight company based in Long Beach). We talked about a lot of things, but never about what had
happened that day, or about the tape.

The rest of that year, I basically spent about three days a week in the dorm, and the rest with her.
This pattern continued for a while: I couldn't exactly move in with her without letting my parents know
what was going on (she told her friends that I was 17, and that seemed to mollify them--I was pretty
tall and obviously wasn't going to high school--though they still cracked jokes about her robbing the
cradle). We swore to keep our history a secret. I graduated two years before her, and we used my NSF
fellowship (I was staying for grad school) to rent a small place while she finished (she hadn't had any
clients since we'd met).

Alpha was best man at our wedding, which we held right after I defended my dissertation on algebraic
K-theory. The bachelor party was actually very subdued: I still couldn't drink legally, and by then all
my friends had come to know better than to do wild stuff with me around. We postponed our honeymoon
until that summer, when she'd finished her master's thesis in political science and we had a little time
before my postdoc at UCLA and her classes started at RAND. Our life together was wonderful.
One day, though, about a week after we'd returned from our honeymoon, I found a package on our front
door. There was no return address. I opened it and looked inside. Inside there was a videotape. I had
seen the same videotape, six years ago, on my wife's bed that fateful day. I actually passed out at this
point. When I came to, she was crying. I looked down and saw that I was in a hospital bed. She said
"thank God you're okay" and stammered something about how scared she'd been. Apparently it was a day
later: I'd fallen onto our coffee table and lost a lot of blood before she'd come home. She'd called the
paramedics and seen the tape afterwords, then passed out herself.

I asked her then who else could have seen the tape. She said that a cop had knocked down the door for
the paramedics but this had woken her up, and she'd managed to close the package and shove it next to
some boxes we were packing for our move before they got to us. She'd told them that she'd had a panic
attack after calling 911 and they seemed to have been satisfied by that. Nobody else had seen anything.
But that left the nagging question of who could have sent it in the first place. When I was released the
next day, we took a look at the package. The handwriting looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. Then
I noticed the postmark. It was the same as the letter awarding me my postdoc: it was sent from the UCLA
post office. I looked at my wife and told her not to worry, but I was plenty worried myself. She just
nodded weakly.

I was supposed to move the next week, a week ahead of her, and we didn't talk about the tape until after
the cab came to pick me up. I just told her "I'll take care of it". She sent me on my way with a kiss
and slipped my ticket into my sportcoat with a wan smile. I couldn't sleep on the plane, even though I
had gotten an upgrade to first class. I took a cab to our new apartment and slept fitfully on the floor
that night.

Early the next morning I checked my mail at the Mathematical Sciences building. There was a note in the
same handwriting as the package (which I'd brought to my apartment in my checked bag). It just said "Go
past Kauffman Hall to Sunset and turn right. [XXX] Udine. I'll be here." My heart was pounding in my
chest. I called my wife and said "It'll all be over soon", then hung up before she could say anything. I
went back to my apartment and picked up the package, then set off past the student center and Kauffman,
then along Sunset. Udine Way was about a mile from the math building, and the walk gave me a chance to
think and collect myself. I started to formulate a theory.

The address on Udine was a house. A really nice house. I was a little surprised, but not much. It was
still early when I got there, around over 9,000 or 8. I knocked on the door. A maid answered: I was
expected, and would I please have a seat in the drawing room? She led me there, across marble tiles and
into a room decorated in a Baroque motif accented with a few subtle touches of modernity.
A couple of minutes later I heard footsteps approaching. Alpha came in and smiled. I laughed and we
shook hands, and he asked me to follow him to his study. Baroque again, but the touches of modernity
were more obvious here: a G3 desktop and a Dell stood out. He told me to have a seat and gestured at a
Louis XIV chair. I was finally there. I handed him the package. He smiled and took out the videotape.
I heard the muffled, panicked grunts and scuffles; the throttled howls of agony and pain, and I did not
need to open my eyes to know what was transpiring on the screen. Alpha called for the maid and the sound
from the tape stopped. I opened my eyes just as the maid appeared. Alpha nodded at her and she turned
around briskly and left. I heard her walking away. The tape had been paused. I tried to think about
something else besides what was on that tape to keep from getting any more aroused. Soon after some
footsteps drew nearer. My wife walked in, with moist eyes and a pleading smile. I looked away from her. I couldn't stand up.

She spoke in a gentle voice that made me think of waves over smooth stones. "We have to stop. It's not
right. Those are actual people. We're responsible." I looked back at her, too baffled by her presence to
process her words. "Alpha knew about both of us from the beginning. That's why he brought us together."
I couldn't believe I'd laughed when I'd seen him. I felt nauseous and tried to remind myself that he was
my best friend, and that that was real.

"How?"
She started to speak, but Alpha raised a hand. "I'd gone to use a computer in Rittenhouse: there was one
with Netscape open. I just wanted to do something quick, so I figured I'd just use it instead of logging
in at another box. It was open to the Los Alamos preprint server, and I knew you went there a lot: you
were always talking about physics being geometry and this cool site where you could look at all the
latest stuff. I figured it was probably your session. I remember looking around to see if you were
nearby and opening your bookmarks. I was interested in you! You were just a kid, and everyone was
fascinated by you. So I looked. That's when I found out. I already knew about her."

"How?"
They looked at each other, wondering who would answer. I knew enough. Knew he'd slept with her first. I
imagined him finding her videotape and watching it. I wondered how she'd explained it to him. Wondered
what he'd thought. I didn't want to know about it, and they clearly didn't want to tell me. All that
mattered was that however imperfectly, we three understood each other, and always had. The fear I'd felt
was replaced with a dawning sense of dread, though.

"Why?"
"Because I knew both of you were really good, decent people. I thought each of you deserved a chance at
happiness and I knew how hard it would be for you to find it with anyone else. I paid close attention to
you"--he looked at me--"and told her about you. If you hadn't shown her the printouts, she'd've taken
the tape out anyway. I didn't think about the long-term consequences then. But now the two of you have
to make a choice. Together."

I looked down, ashamed. I couldn't bear to face either of them. "We're not hurting anyone."
She came over to me, knelt in front of me, and looked up. "That's not true. Those people are
suffering - some of those people are dying! - and we're part of it. We have to do what's right. It's the
only way we can really be free." I buried my face in my hands. She was right and I knew it. She put her
hand on my knee and kissed me on the cheek as she stood up.

"Why now? Why not then?"
Alpha shrugged, faltered, then took a deep breath. "Honestly, I'd considered telling someone instead of
doing what I did. But that would have ruined your life. You had so much potential. I couldn't do it. I
made a choice of my own: to give you a chance at happiness and at having a good life, even if it meant
that you might actually follow through on" - he gestured at the TV - "that. And I think it was the right
choice now. You've done well, and your life is still in front of you. But now you're old enough to truly
understand moral sacrifice. I can't let you keep doing this. I need your word: that'll be good enough
for me."

"What if I say no?"
"Then I'll stop this myself. I'll call the Feds. I know you. If you can stop, you will. And if you
can't, then you might start actually doing this stuff yourself instead of just watching it and acting it
out. I can't live with that."

"How do you know I'll keep my word?"
"I don't, really. But I'm your friend. I know you're a good person. I believe you can stop this. But I
can tell when you're lying. You're a miserable liar." This was only too true. "I'll be keeping in touch
with you. And if you break your word, I'll know. And I'll call the Feds."

"What other choice do I have?" Alpha just shrugged again. I looked at the TV, then at my wife. She was
transfixed by the paused image. I thought again of our first time together. How we'd come at the same
time watching that tape, then collapsed into each other, terrified of the future and of each other.
Seeking a kind of solace in each other. Seeking ourselves in each other.

I managed to get her to look away from the TV and at me. "What about you?"
"I've made my choice. Alpha's right: we have to stop."
The three of us were silent for about half a minute. I knew because I looked at my watch the entire
time. It seemed like hours.

"Can we have this one last time?" I was asking both of them. Alpha sighed and started to leave without
looking at either of us. He said "I'll give you an hour" in a dead voice as he left the room. But it
wasn't like the first time. She looked away from me and crossed her arms. I got up and moved to touch
her. She flinched, then melted into me. We both cried.

"God help us." I don't know which one of us said it, but neither one of us believed in God. I kissed
her, gently, then passionately. She sniffled and started the tape again.

Now, this is a story all about how My life got knifed; turned inside out And I'd like to take a minute: just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In West Philadelphia as a kid I was hazed 'Cuz I was takin' grad classes at Penn in those days Chillin' out fappin' relaxin' all cool And checkin' out pics of chicks eating their stool When I saw a website that was up to no good And found out that snuff films would give me wood I fapped to one little murder and my friend got scared And set me up with a chick whose sick fetish I shared

I nervously propositioned her one fine summer day But she took me to her car and we were on our way She gave me a few minutes and a quick fap was the ticket I did some Jello shots and said I might as well kick it

The whole thing had been planned way back in the day Turned out she was a hooker but I wouldn't have to pay She took me to her bedroom with porn that was illicit And once my buddies left I knew just where to stick it

I stayed for a PhD and when graduation came near I got a postdoc at UCLA and I married my dear If anything I could say that this time was rare But things got intense when I got some mail from Bel Air

First class, yo this is bad I was sleepless on the flight and pondered what would pass If this what the people of Bel Air livin' like The future don't look so bright!

I walked up to a house about seven or eight After I got a note sayin' yo homes, come by later My old buddy owned the place and I was finally there But I still wasn't quite the Prince of Bel Air

Because guess who walked in on that fateful day? My wife showed up and she had some things to say She told me that we'd gone too far, past the limit I tried to deny it and I started to fidget

But even though I couldn't watch snuff after that day I figured it was still early and I wanted to play And even though it was bad to get off to maggots I listened to my dick and heard DO IT FAGGOT

I fuck her from behind and at the TV I stare There's an infected leg and a knife makes a tear If anything I could say that this porn was rare But I thought "naw, forget it" and blew my load in Bel Air

I reckoned I could still see guro with my mate But I knew I'd never watch any snuff again later I staggered; fell back into a Louis XIV chair And relaxed on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

== Extra gravy ==

Well, never mind all that, >>1. This has nothing to do with this thread, but would you just listen to me for a little bit? See, I went to the local Yoshinoya today. Right. Yoshinoya. And the damn place was packed so full of people, I couldn't even find a seat. So I looked around a bit, and I found a sign that said "150 yen off". What the hell is wrong with you people? Are you idiots or something? Any other day you wouldn't even think of going to Yoshinoya, but if it's 150 yen off, you all flock in here? It's just 150 fucking yen! 150 yen! And you're bringing the kids too. Look at that, a family of four going to Yoshinoya. Con-fucking-gratulations. And now the guy's going, "All right! Daddy's going to order the extra-large!" Shit, I can't watch any more of this. Yoshinoya should be fucking brutal. Two guys sit facing each other across a U-shaped table, and you never quite know if they'll suddenly just start a fight right there. It's stab-or-be-stabbed, and that's what so damn great about the place. Women and kids should stay the fuck away. Well, I finally found a seat, but then the guy next to me goes, "I'll have a large bowl with extra gravy!". So now I'm pissed off again. Who the fuck orders extra gravy these days? Why are you looking so goddamn proud when you say that? I was gonna ask you, are you really going to fucking eat all that gravy? I wanted to fucking interrogate you. For about a fucking hour. You know what? I think you just wanted to say "extra gravy". Now, take it from the Yoshinoya veteran. The latest thing among the Yoshinoya pros is this: Extra green onions. That's the ticket. A large bowl with extra onions, and egg. This is what someone who knows his shit orders. They put in more onions, and less meat. A large bowl with the raw egg, that's really fucking awesome. Now, you should know, if you keep ordering this, there's a risk employees might write you up. This really is a double-edged sword. I really can't recommend this for amateurs. And you, >>1, well, you should really just stick to today's special. 

== The FBI is watching ==

You should probably read this.

Just listen to me. I am posting this thread because the FBI is at my house, questioning me about my internet habits. As you can see, they have discovered that I browse /b/ by looking at my internet history. They are standing over my shoulder right now, watching me type this. I'd like to show them what a great site 4chan is. Nothing questionable, remotely offensive, or anything that would otherwise put my patriotism in question.

Lost my courage dog folder, so here's a perfectly safe reason to post in this thread. I am in need of moar courage dog. Just remember:

The FBI are watching you, /b/.

Game up to their expectations. 

== FLCL ==

ha ha, i watch flcl too. it's so underground. i thought i was the only one. we can die together.

== For 23 years ==

For 23 years and 11 months had I suffered them, the ignorant gaijin back home who sickened me with their microwaved culture and their materialism. The spindly losers in the anime club who cared only for anime and not a whit for the superior monoethnic culture to which it was endemic. Well no more. Fucking zettai no more. I touched down in the country I was certain I had lived all my previous lives, no doubt as a badass ronin samurai ninja or some shit. I had never been here, but I had returned.

Nippon-sama, tadaima!

No sooner had I left the airport when I saw the woman of my dreams. She confirmed my every hope, my every ideal of this great land. The light coming in through the sakura backlit her like a full body halo. She was made of demure and soft spoken. Of bowing and bento.

Of Japan and perfect.

My heart started doki doki-ing all over the shop. And then she saw me! Spotted me in the crowd! Well, of course she did, I was like a head taller than the fucking hobbits they call men around here. I was in no state of mind to meet her gaze, and tried to look away but I was paralysed. She was just so ... prettyu ...

And just like that she started walking over. Her walk was just pure concentrated sex. If you poured a glass of it sex fumes would just rise right off the top. I loved the way the light danced unevenly over her pristine porcelain skin as she walked. The way she did more for me by showing just her shoulders than any American girls could by showing their entire gaping cleavage for all the world to SEE THIS YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTES, THIS IS WHAT SEXY IS YOU FUCKING WHORES -

== Furfag in over ==

hello /b/ i probably wont be here for a while but we will get to that part later.

so here i am with my friend, i called him up and asked if he wanted to come over after work to hang out and we got back at about 6;30. We make some popcorn and start playing some halo coop. We are talking about sex in video games and the conversation drifted to the internet when he says "have you ever seen fur art? i kind of like it and i post at an internet forum for it too sometimes, you should check it out"

i just stared at him for a few seconds then i got up and went up stairs. I opened the door to my room and just moped around a bit, i started to rummage through some party wigs in my closet and i found a dark colored afro one, i held it in my hands looking at it before putting it on, then i went over to the bathroom and just sat on the floor staring at the mirror for what seemed like hours. I could hear from downstairs that he had started to play the game again, after a few more minuets i got up, went up into the attic and grabbed a baseball bat, i walked downstairs careful not to knock over the potted plants, i could see him sitting on the couch there, focused completely on the game, my free hand started to twitch a little bit, he was to talking to me again; "hey can you get me a soda from the fridge buddy?" it seemed to break a trance that i was in, like i just woke up from a dream, my right hand griped the bat so hard my fingers turned white.

I walked up behind him and swung the bat at him, cracking him right below the back of his head, it sent him tumbling off the couch, i could see he was bleeding on the floor and it made me angry, i felt like i was going into a haze again, his eyes were spinning and they were beginning to turn white, i raised the bat up high and brought it down on his chest, there was a slight crunch and he huffed loudly as air escaped, he groaned slightly and i screamed as loud as i could at him; "FURFAG GOES IN EVERY OVEN!" i hauled him up by his neck and legs and tossed him into the street.

after a few days i hear he was hospitalized, apparently i had fractured one of his ribs and a bone fragment punctured his liver.

so now i am facing three years in prison with no parole for aggravated assault, 1y 8 months on good behavior, if you ever asked me, was it worth it, well to tell the truth, yes, yes it was worth it.

and i would do it again too 

== Furry Texan ==

I've been a Furry for 10 years now and want to stop. The problem is that the group of furs that I hang out with don't like me now and if I took my fursuit off, they would probably beat me up and kill me. My last boyfriend (a cute b/w wolf) gave me herpes on my ass and now I have a hard time taking a shit. Sometimes I have to take an Ex-lax so my shit will come out easy.

I've never had sex with a girl, because I don't know how to pick them up. That's why I turned Furry. But now I'm just tired of guys ripping my ass when they don't use lubrication. I've had to get stitches three times. I went out with a fox last night who said he only gives, he doesn't receive, so I had to suck his dick and he made me swallow or he would kick my ass.

== Gamespot Idiots ==

Did you see this? Did you hear about this?

Those fuckers SHAFTED AND ROBBED MODERN WARFARE 2.

No fucking awards. NONE. NOT ONE. Instead, listen to this shit:

GAME OF THE YEARS >Demon's Souls (faggy weeaboo piece of shit)

Best Shooter >Killzone 2 (laggy, slow faggot fanboy shit game with blurry graphics)

Best online >Killzone 2 (unplayable impossible to aim piece of fuck)

Best Sound >Killzone 2 (fucking niggers)

Most Improved Sequel >Killzone 2 (the shit is THIS. MW2 had this fucking award in a LOCK, biased sons of bitches)

Man, mother fucking MW2 wasn't even NOMINATED for GOTY. But fucking Demon's Souls and Killzone 2 were. This is some shit and I say we fucking fire up the LOIC and take those nigger loving racist pieces of shits DOWN. 

== A gentleman's agreement ==

Salutations good sirs. Within a fortnight I shall set forth, with my Queen's congee of course, on a voyage to the Southernmost Colonies. In the Southland I design to retrieve a large shipment of these newfound creatures called "Negroids". Upon my return from the colonies I would be happy to bequeath you one or two for your sport. However, an exchange must take place. I require several daguerreotype depictions of bantam youngsters in "salacious" poses to add to my quite substantial collection. I propose we form a gentleman's agreement, if you could supply these daguerreotypes in advance of our exchange I would happily supply a half-ape-half-man creature at the time of our meeting. Do respond in haste my good sirs for I dare say my interest has been piqued. I have included a related vignette of my cargo for your appraisal. If the benevolent proprietors of this fine establishment are to find my libidinous requests deviant, then I suspect a ban from the premises and an assemblage of celebratory buggies outside my residence may be in order.

Sincerely and with great respect, Sir David V. Thomas 

== Girl gamer ==

Hey /b/, I'm a girl gamer.

No I'm not fat. No I won't make you a sandwich. No I'm not ugly. No I don't go out with guy gamers, because they're usually socially retarded and ugly. Yes my boyfriend is a bit of a jock, so what? No I won't show you my tits, so don't fucking ask.

And finally.

Yes, we do fucking exist, so stop saying otherwise. And we enjoy games (SHOCK HORROR) just as much as men. 

== Girl scout ==

OK, /b/, here's what happened. I was sitting around the house yesterday, minding my own business, when I heard a knock at the door. I opened it, and there stood a cute little loli (maybe7-8yo)! She's dressed in this hot short skirt, and some kind of military fetish outfit, called herself a "girl scout", or something like that. Another word for hooker, as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, after some haggling, I got something you aren't gonna BELIEVE! She was selling BOXED LOLIS! That's right! Every box had pictures of some of the most rapeable cake you've ever laid eyes on. Some boxes had 5or6 on the cover! Well, hell if I'm gonna pass up an opportunity like this! So I dumped $400, the whole damn supply. Then I slammed the door in her face, stripped, covered my self in cooking oil and ripped those suckers open in a sex-crazed frenzy. What the fuck do I find scattered all over my floor? Helpless lolis screaming for mercy? Children huddling in corners trying futilely to escape my embrace? FUCK NO! A bunch of goddamn COOKIES! I grab my bat, ran outside flinging oil and profanity in every direction, only to find the little cunt making her escape in an unmarked minivan. But she'll get hers. I've heard this story time and time again, by other poor souls who've been taken advantage of by these evil bitches. And... I've found the location of their secret base. Girl Scouts of the USA 420 Fifth Avenue New York, New York 10018-2798 (800) 478-7248. I've got a machete, 3 bottles of vegetable oil, and a raging, throbbing, rock hard sense of burning justice. Are you with me /b/? Help avenge your /b/rothers shattered hopes and dreams! ALL PERSONNEL, REPORT IN! ETA on target @ 23:59:59 tonight! 

== Girl farts ==

I just learned that girls farts smell better than video games.

Seriously. You know that new game package smell? Like when you just took off the wrapping? My god, its a glorious smell. I've masturbated sniffing this smell so many times. It's great and the main reason I still buy games.

But my sister just farted on the couch next to me while I was playing Street Fighter IV. She blushed got up fanned her ass and ran to the bathroom to, I assume, shit or maybe she shit herself while she was next to me, there was some extra bulge in the back of her jeans. Now let me reiterate. She was sitting directly next to me. In effect, she farted on my side and then waved fart gas from her butt to my face. Now you fucking listen to me. This smelled glorious. I immediately became rock hard and didn't give a shit, I pulled my cock out and masturbated right there smelling my own sister fart. I didn't even care that I got beat by a scrub Ken while I was jerking off. 

== The grimer of retribution ==

Long time ago the class "Paladin" was born and it had survived from many unfortunate and horrifying events. Among the paladins the rank of retribution was the most fearsome. The retribution paladin knows not fear they strike in to the heart of their enemy and deal complete destruction. But lately the balances of the paladin order have been Brocken. The supreme power of the retribution has been mocked. The retribution paladin has become the lowest of the lowest rank. this was result of the jealousy and hatred from other ranks and classes. As been one of the few surviving hero class the paladins has been targeted. Not only the order was mocked the creators even further disgraced the order by giving the holy sacred power over to the horde. The end is near unless those ranks of holy and protection realize what is happening. 

== Hentai isn't bullshit ==

hey /b/ japanese cumdumpster here. i know, fucked up, right?

so, you think the stuff you see in hentai is bullshit? cause i tell you, these days i find out some are NOT.

so i was getting subway home, right? it was a little late and as our subway is famour for, it was very crowded. and all of sudden i feel a hand crawling up my legs!! it just stop before getting to my skirt and i thought it was just an accident. and then there it go again, this time the hand firmly grips my ass cheek and squeeze!!! i was so mad!!

so i slapped whoever the guy was 's hand away and turned around to give him a glare. so creepy!! he like 20 years older than me, and im 19

i thought he would back off after glare but he put fingers right between my legs, i kind of freeze for moment because that was the most disgusting thing i ever experience

i was so embarassed i couldn't scream. you see, in japan some girls slutty, but for others honor is important. so i just walked away and was tankful the next station was osaka, where i live

really, nothing alike happen to me before. i always think hentai was bullshit was i guess the authors really dont come up with their stories out of nowhere

what do you think i should have done, /b/? im really sad right now, there's no one i can speak my friends would think it so weird so i come and share this with you 

== HOW TO BE AN ANARCHIST!!! ==

##1.0.##[DIRTY DOORMAT]########################################################
to do this you will need a piece of paper and a bright crayon or pen. you
should keep in mind that paper is white so yellow and pink are not good choices

SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO?:

1.take the paper and the crayon or pen (I WILL BE CALLING IT A CRAYON FROM NOW
ON TO AVOID WRITING TWO SEPARATE TECHNIQUES) and write something totally
offensive on it like "SHIT" or if youre feeling really nihilistic i guess you
could use something even more offensive but dont go overboard because the man
is always watching!!

2.put the piece of paper on your doormat with the words facing upwards so when
the mailman comes in the morning to give you letters he will see the words you
wrote and he will think like "Wow This House is full of Anarchists!! Better
Watch out!!" and maybe if youre lucky he will forget a letter and youll be
able to tell your friends that mailmen suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

##1.1.##[TAPER CAPERS]#########################################################
this is a neat trick you can do in the evening when youre bored and anarchy is
on your mind! just be sure you have tape (not clear tape.. even tho you can do
some pretty nifty tricks with clear tape) and scissors (if you dont have any..
then as i say "what Kind of Anarchist Are You!"

TELL ME ZAZIKERNG HOW DO I HAVE ANARCHY IN MY HOME WITH JUST TAPE?:

1.first this is a pretty easy trick to do but make sure you don't have to
clean up in your house this week or something.. youll have to clean up the
windows... grade a punishment straight from the government...

2.anyway... go look for a window in your house.. it shouldnt be too hard heh
ok now take the tape and with the help of your scissors (i hope you have some
..) make a big anarchy sign on the window.. to help you i made this diagram:

________________
/________________\
/ / / / \ \ \ \
/ / / / \ \ \ \
/ / / / \ \ \ \
|_|____/_/_______\_\___|_|
|________________________|
| | / / \ \ | |
| | / / \ \ | |
\ \/ / \ \/ /
\ \/ \/ /
\_\________________/_/
\__________________/

3.sorry its not perfect... but im still learning.. anyway next time someone
walks past your house they will think "Oh how Good this is a Pretty House..
I Think some nice Capitalist People live in There..." and then they will see
the anarchy sign and their minds will be confused.. "Oh No my Guess was Wrong
this is an Anarchist House!!!!!!!"

IDEAS:
1. this only works if you have bushes or nice hiding places at your house..
after you make the sign go outside and hide... then you have to wait.. when
you see a person come up wait for his face to change to terror as he sees
it.. now is your moment to strike... jump out of your hiding place and say
"I did This... I am Starting a Anarchist Revolution... Get Ready Capitalist
Pig.." and then either hell get scared and run away and you can tell all your
anarchist buddies/BBSes about what happened... and then youll get new friends
or.. if he doesnt run away he might join you and then youll have another
anarchist warrior to help you... this will double your anarchy potential



##2.0.##[LOCKER ANARCHY]#######################################################
very nice good trick i learned when i went to the school... of anarchy!! all
you need is some keys and a school with some lockers in it.. lockers are bad
because they are made to hide secret megacorporation information used to
make people mindless slaves!!

WHAT TO DO:

1. get your keys (or mayb knife if you are a experinced anarchist..) and find
the locker of your capitalist enemy.. in next part you need to unleash some
fury!!

2. use your keys to scrape some anarchy sign or threat on your enemys locker!
HAHAHA!!

3. wait for your enemy to arive.. watch as he falls on his knees and starts
to cry!! a capitalist enemie destroyed mentally.... one less enemei in the
world... ANARCHY REVALUTION IS HERE!!

IDEAS:
1. use red crayon instead of key.. your enemy wil think you used blood to
draw the sign or threat or something... one time i heard he killed
himself...
2. use clear tape like in 1.1 TAPER CAPERS
3. draw anarchie logo on your own locker... evryone will know you are a
anarchist and are afraid to go to your locker.. othar than mayb other
anarchists....but thats good because you can build anarchiste army
easily

##2.1.##[TEACHER DESTROY]######################################################
this is the first article on destroying teacher completely... its very good
help for begining anarchists because teacher are working for the man to
to control your mind... and make you capitalist!! it helps if you are one of
the neon knights of metaland.. you need some spraypaint i hope you can get it

TO DESTROY TEACHER COMPLTELY:

1. wait for your teacher to say sumthing stupid and capitalist to you.. like
tell you false information like anarchy sucks or something...

2. say FUK U i'm your anarchy name here and spraypaint anarchy logo on wall

3. break window and jump out.. if its higher than second floor they wil think
you are imortal.. u can use this as advantayge.

4. leave school or go kick some windows.. watever anarchist stuf you can think
of.. teacher shud be ready for mental hospital now!! hahaha! anarchie wins
again

IDEAS:
you can do prety much anythin you want... teachers are weak beings easily
destroyd!! this is very basic article.. go try it 

== I am the cancer ==

I am proud to say i am the cancer that is killing /b/. /b/ is the cancer that is killing the internet. The internet is the cancer that is killing western civilization. western civilization is the cancer that is killing humanity. humanity is the cancer that is killing the earth. Why am i proud to say that i am the cancer of the cancer of the cancer of the cancer? because i have cancer and it's killing me. 

== I consider myself 100% straight ==

I consider myself 100% straight. I have zero attraction toward men but I find big penises sort of attractive.

I love women so much I grow a little jealous of their looks. I dress up in women's lingerie and jack off while watching blowjob porn while imagining myself as the girl.

I still don't find men attractive though. Anyone feel like this?

== I hate girls ==

Something horrible happened to me today.

This girl that I liked walked up to me during lunch break, along with her friends following her. I was very nervous already -like I always am with girls- and could tell from the heat on my face I was heavily blushing, which made me even more nervous. To add to that, her friends were laughing behind her shoulders, so I smelled something fishy right away.

The worst thing that has ever happened to me then occurred. Never in my life have I felt so miserable. She looked at me with a grin on her face, and told me that first off she never liked me, and was just playing with me for a laugh. Then, she added that I was ugly and that no one would ever want to be with someone like me. Behind her, her friends were laughing and capturing the whole scene with their camera phones (so yeah, it was probably planned from the start, all to have a big laugh at me)

I didn't even know how to react, so many people were around and looking at me that I just felt I was going to fall unconscious. I walked out of there mechanically -I was barely able to think- as quickly as I could with tears I was hardly keeping and went to the bathroom to CRY. I hadn't cried for years and there I was, in the fucking canteen's bathroom crying.

I'm a fucking loser and I hate myself SO FUCKING BAD. I hate girls and I hate humans. They rob you of every single piece of self-esteem you have for their own self-enjoyment. How the fuck am I supposed to go on with life when people are so horrible?

FUCK 

== I hate Ubuntu ==

 hate Ubuntu. I immediately lose respect for anyone who runs it, and especially those who advocate it. Here’s why:

Name 20 features, release-for-release or year-for-year that have not come from Redhat. Redhat basically runs the show when it comes to Linux. This includes things like NetworkManager, Gnome, Xorg, GCC, glibc, LVM, KVM, kernel, file systems et al. Redhat has developers making significant contributions to the entire FOSS software stack upstream.

Ubuntu on the other hand pulls most of the heavy weight packaging from Debian with each release. They then perform minor patching and testing. It generally lags behind Fedora by a release or two in parts of the software stack. I never see @ubuntu or @cannocial email addresses in upstream changelogs.

So tell me again, how exactly does Ubuntu innovate? They even struggle to release a new theme with each release, and artwork is about the only original thing in Ubuntu.

Yes, Ubuntu is stable because they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Most of the hard work is hashed out before they ever import software into their repositories. This is fine, and what FOSS is all about, but I prefer to be in with the leaders rather than the followers.

What really irks me and what has really brewed my hatred are Ubuntu users. They seem to think Ubuntu is responsible for all that is good in the FOSS world. I have just proven how false this is. In my experience, Ubuntu support mechanisms (IRC, mailing lists, forums) are much less helpful than the alternative.

If you want a nice desktop distro, run Fedora or OpenSUSE. If you like control, run Gentoo. If you need stability, run RHEL/CentOS or Debian. But please, don’t feed the idiot magnet that is Ubuntu! 

== I hate weeaboos ==

I hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. FUCK YOU WEEABOOS

So my question is, how good are my chances of becoming Japanese for real? 

== I have a ritual called "terminator" ==

I have a ritual called "terminator". I crouch in the shower in the "naked terminator" pose. With eyes closed I crouch for a minute and visualize either Arnie or the guy from the 2nd movie. I then start to hum the T2 theme. Slowly I rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me get through my day. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It sorta ruins the fantasy. 

== Imagine a giant flying penis ==

Imagine a giant penis flying towards your mouth, and there's nothing you can do about it. And you're like "Oh man, I'm gonna have to suck this thing", and you brace yourself to suck this giant penis. But then, at the last moment, it changes trajectory and hits you in the eye. You think to yourself "Well, at least I got that out of the way", but then the giant penis rears back and stabs your eye again, and again, and again. Eventually, this giant penis is penetrating your gray matter, and you begin to lose control of your motor skills. That's when the giant penis slaps you across the cheek, causing you to fall out of your chair. Unable to move and at your most vulnerable, the giant penis finally lodges itself in your anus, where it rests uncomfortably for 4, maybe 5 hours. That's what using a Mac is like. 

== Jenkem ==

I am writing you anonymously because I do not want my child to get in any trouble, but I need to alert you to something your students are doing that is potentially very dangerous. Yesterday afternoon I came home early to find my son and his friends getting high on something called "jenkem" which they say they heard about at school. This "jenkem" is the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of. They urinate and defecate in plastic bottles and leave them to ferment in the sun, then inhale the resulting gas. I know it sounds unreal but when I came home I found my son and his friends laying on the grass in the backyard and they were acting very strangely. There was a horrible, putrid smell in the air. I can't believe my son would do something like this. I looked it up on the internet and apparently this was something invented by African children that wound up online and now kids all over the world are doing it. My son says most of his friends at school have tried it.

This seems to be a new thing and I can't find any information about the health effects of jenkem - I think it is the methane and ammonia content that provides the desired high, but I don't really know. Both of those are very harmful chemicals. All sorts of diseases are spread through fecal matter. I imagine it could lead to some very serious health problems at you school. My wife and I are utterly shocked and talking about private school. We have talked to our son about this and he says he won't do it anymore, but because it is on the internet kids all over the country are trying jenkem and they need to be educated about the health risks. It is only a matter of time before somebody dies from methane poisoning or this leads to a hepatitic outbreak. I don't know exactly what you could do about this as jenkem is legal but I needed to inform you of what some of your students are doing. 

== JPEG ==

Because JPEGs are more heavily compressed than other image formats, their information is more volatile and likely to expand at high speed through an unchecked buffer, poorly allocated resource or any other available system space. I'd guess you're probably losing image data through one of these means.

You see, when you load a JPEG into memory, the EXtra colour Information Format (EXIF) header is loaded into RAM in order to prepare the video prebuffer for the incoming high-speed flow of colour information from the uncorked JPEG. If your bus isn't ready for this information, the rapidly decompressing file information can flow through other parts of your system.

Ordinarily this isn't a problem: as a matter of fact, JPEG was designed for this sort of thing. Older computers couldn't handle the explosive power behind the fledgeling image decompression algorithm, so rather than fight it, image experts invented the Jampacked Picture Extraction and Gathering (JPEG) protocol. They cleverly decided to allow the image data to spray wherever it would, knowing that after the extraction phase would send raw data all over the inside of the computer, the gathering phase would locate it all and reassemble it into an image. With the advent of faster computers the delay between spray and collection is so small as to be unnoticeable, while newer and bigger video cards are more capable of withstanding the onslaught of colours.

Still, the primary weakness of this algorithm is the haphazard placement of decompressed data. There's just too much of it to channel through normal means, so any loss of data containment results in corrupted images. In your case, it would appear that you're losing image data through the empty hole where your goddamned shift key should be. 

== Krystal Lee Pender ==

Hey! =] I’m Krystal Lee Pender and I can’t help but think I’m truly amazing. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not perfect, but I think we can all agree that we’ve got a pretty fine piece of RAW MEAT on our hands. Now, before I come out with my life problems, I must tell you first about my life. Born and raised in Vegas, moved to Hillsborough at age 13 and started my life as a farmer on Amwell Road with my family of thirty kitties. For a reason which I will not go into (FOR NOW), my farming experience turned out for the worst, and I was unable to produce a cash crop to support my raw meat body. I was hungry, poor, and famlyless as my kitties were all dead for I was unable to feed their holocaust like bodies after several weeks. Finally after entering high school, I met a frisky girl named Tina Pender. Strange thing is that Tina and I share something very similar…say, a last name? And what better of a last name to have. WE’RE EXTRA TENDA LIKE A DOUBLE MEATY PENDA.

Enough said for that- I shall now tell you the relationship I have with Tina Pender. Tina is a fair woman with several love handles that I love to grab onto while we preform the most intimate of moments. It gets even weirder when I tell you that Tina and I are almost identical in physical appearance. About a week ago Tina penetrated my human ass with a strap on in the middle of the night and I was forced into having sex with her, although I would not call this rape. Tina humped me for over thirty hours. Once she was done she got up and spun about as though she was being watched by thousands of people, with her being a famous dancer. This, obviously was not the case. The naked Tina Pender stood before me, sweating and red. She screamed obnoxiously and jumped to the door, flying fifteen feet across the room at an unnaturally slow speed. With that, I woke up and started my day just as usual. A day past and I happened to have the idea of a pregnancy test. Well, luck for me the test came out positive.

OKAY SO YOU ALL MUST BE WONDERING THE PRECIOUS QUESTION I’M GOING TO ASK YOU…….IS TINA A MAN? THINKING BACK, I CANNOT RECALL IF THE “STRAPON” WAS TRULY AS STRAPON OR A REAL PENIS. HELP! =] <33333 

== Legend of 4chan ==

Legend has it that if you travel east to Japan, you will find an old man living on the coast just 40 miles south of Tokyo. If you give this man $500,000 he will take you to an island just off the coast that can't be found on any map. This island is filled with people without faces or names, who hold grudges over the most trivial of matters. When you arrive at this island the first thing you will see is a swimming pool that is never open. Just beyond the pool you will find a town that is filled with cats. You must find a white cat wearing a pink bow. If you ask the cat how to get to Mexico, he will stand up and ask you for three things: Your name, your face, and your soul. If you agree to give them to him, your face will vanish and you will forget your own name. You can live on the island and have whatever you desire, but you can never leave the island. The only way to escape is to find the cat again and ask for a young child. The next day a van will pull up in front your house. You will hear a knock at the door, and a voice will ask if you want to come to a party. No one knows what happens if you answer the door.
