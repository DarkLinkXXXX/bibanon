Once, around 2010-2012, there was a group of indie voice actors who made amazing comic dubs, creating a gripping TV show that reflected the madness of the internet.

The major component of a comic dub is of course, the audio, by indie voice actors who exhibit gripping emotion in their voice. A comic dub is also a powerful visual medium, which, (by using transitions, text fade-in, and moving text), can to turn an otherwise static comic strip into an amazing TV show. 

Nowadays, comic dubs are a dying art. Keep it alive, it's one of the Internet's Intangible Cultural Heritages.

## How to Make a Comic Dub

A comic dub has the power to turn a static image into an amazing TV show. Usually, the audio is created first, and the visual effects are made to match. Key to a comic dub is the illusion of movement.

Segments of text should fade-in as the dialogue is spoken (much like subtitles), rather than posted as a chunk. This gives the illusion of movement, and allows the viewer to hear rather than read. The easiest way to do this is to erase chunks of text with Paint or something.

Transitions also give a feeling of progression. Where there is no movement, don't use it. If you've reached the end, fade to black. If something profound was stated, zoom into the face. If you're feeling ironic, make spins.

Most of all, print out the comic, cut out the panels, and make a storyboard showing what to say, and what transitions to make. It keeps things organized and makes life easier.
